<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Cosmology/Inner Realms/Eight Realms of Hell/Eight Realms of Hell\|Eight Realms of Hell]] → Synag</sup></sup> 
The smallest of demiplanes that make up the Eight Realms of Hell, Synag is made up entirely of a lake, whose water overflows into the other realms creating the rivers that run through each of them, tiny craggy islands in said lake, and a large castle in the center of the lake. This castle, known as [[Creatrix\|Creatrix]], is the location where the [[Lords of Hell\|Lords of Hell]] and their generals meet for several reasons and once each millennium to reaffirm the [[Infernal Equilibrium\|Infernal Equilibrium]], which is an agreement among the [[Lords of Hell\|Lords of Hell]] that none of them will attempt to invade and control any of the other realms and that if any of them break this agreement, the other six Lords will join each other in defeating the invader. The [[Infernal Equilibrium\|Infernal Equilibrium]] is hardly a peace treaty though and the [[Lords of Hell\|Lords]] send their armies against each other commonly to settle disputes but it must be on an agreed battlefield with clear consequences for failure. [[Lords of Hell\|Lords]] can also back assassins and usurpers who go against other Lords they disagree with, but are banned from trying to use this method to create a puppet nation and effectively control a realm other than their own. Despite this, the [[Lords of Hell\|Lords of Hell]] are infamous for trying stretch these limitations as far as they can without breaking them.

Although technically one of the eight realms that make up [[Cosmology/Inner Realms/Eight Realms of Hell/Eight Realms of Hell\|Hell]], a decidedly evil place in the Omniverse, Synag itself is mostly considered a place of neutrality and several creatures unrelated to the [[Devils\|Devils]] that inhabit the other seven realms take up residence here such as the [[Nosoi\|Nosoi]], who are raven-like creatures that oversee the terms of any deal and write up the actual contracts written in Synag, they are usually seen as annoying bureaucrats to most but they perform a needed duty so they aren't disturbed. Synag is a nexus of souls moving through the Omniverse so is used as a meeting grounds for any and all creatures that deal in souls, [[Angels\|Angels]] and [[Devils\|Devils]] alike.
