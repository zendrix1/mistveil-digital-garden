<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] â†’ Sepulcher Comet</sup></sup> 
A small demiplane that drifts within [[Cosmology/The Sea of Dreams\|The Sea of Dreams]], the Sepulcher Comet is a strange place not easily traveled to and rarely escaped. Little is known about the place except it is home to beings referred to by many names but most commonly, the "[[Unmarred Masters\|Unmarred Masters]]". These entities are as mysterious as their home, with some even claiming them to be gods, but one thing that can not be contested is how powerful they are and that they are able to grant power to others. They have acted as patrons to [[Witches\|Witches]] and [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlocks]] able to contact them to broker a deal and the [[Unmarred Masters\|Unmarred Masters]] always ask for one thing in return for that power; the souls of the living.

On the continent of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]], worshipers of [[Moracai\|Moracai]] call the [[Unmarred Masters\|Unmarred Masters]] their enemies for exactly this reason, seeing the collection of souls to be unnatural and a perversion of their god's domain. Within [[Cosmology/The Sea of Dreams\|The Sea of Dreams]] the Sepulcher Comet is "near" the Material Plane, cosmologically speaking, and is even visible on extremely rare occasions as the [[Cosmology/Ethereum\|Ethereum]] plane surrounding the two collide, appearing like a comet passing overhead with a large purple and black tail. This event has strange effects on the Material Plane, influencing certain magicks and peoples and lasts anywhere from several days to several weeks.
