<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] â†’ Sea of Dreams</sup></sup>
The Sea of Dreams is both arguably the most crucial and the least understood aspect of the study of cosmology. Some of what makes the location (if it can even be considered a location) so difficult to grasp is that the plane (if it can even be considered a plane of existence; although many do) does not follow the standard laws that the other planes of existence follow. This makes it very difficult to describe or understand the Sea of Dreams without just listing off certain facts that is known. Certain pockets of the plane have varying levels of gravity and time moves in unexpected ways, accelerated in some locations and slowed down in others. Physical locations do exist in the Sea of Dreams and there are native races to those places and act effectively as demiplanes ranging in size from small villages to whole continents. These physical locations are believed to be the only places where physical planar travel is possible in the Sea of Dreams. The areas immediately surrounding these areas consist of a fluid-like mystical substance that can be traveled in with special ships. These ships follow this fluid (referred to as the [[Tears of Giants\|Tears of Giants]] by some researchers) as it is shifted across the plane, pushed by energies (referred to as [[Planar Winds\|Planar Winds]]) emanating from large sources of heat in the Sea of Dreams (most notably, the other planes of existence) until they inevitably find their way to another physical location within the Sea of Dreams. Outside of this fluid-like space there is the least understood area of the Sea of Dreams called the [[Dreamscape\|Dreamscape]]. This is a place only able to be visited by using forms of [[Astral Projection\|Astral Projection]] and does not have any laws or rules that it follows. It's fairly accepted that each of the other Planes of Existence somehow exist within the [[Dreamscape\|Dreamscape]] (while themselves also seeming infinite somehow) but all the other information on it is, at best, theories and greatly contested in circles of scholars.
