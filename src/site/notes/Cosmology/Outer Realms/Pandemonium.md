<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] â†’ Pandemonium</sup></sup> 
Also known as the Great Maelstrom for the wild storm of the same name that rages there, the plane of Pandemonium is a place of constant change and the source of most of the chaotic energy that flows across the [[Cosmology/Sea of Dreams\|Sea of Dreams]]. The plane is mostly uninhabitable due to the hostile conditions but certain creatures amazingly have been able to flourish there in spite of this, namely the [[Slaad\|Slaad]], a race of frog-like brutal creatures that relish in causing chaos in any way that they are able.

The Great Maelstrom is a massive storm that ravages across the plane, fueled by the elemental energy released when the Shards that make up the [[Cosmology/Outer Realms/Elemental Conflux\|Elemental Conflux]] collide with each other.

Pandemonium is located on the outer rim of the [[Cosmology/Sea of Dreams\|Sea of Dreams]], pressed against the barrier of [[Cosmology/Ethereum\|Ethereum]] that separates it from the [[Cosmology/Far Realms\|Far Realms]].
