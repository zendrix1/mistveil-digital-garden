<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] â†’ Ethereum</sup></sup>
Ethereum is a strange phenomenon that surrounds the planes of existence while having certain traits of a plane itself. It exists in the same metaphysical location as the plane it surrounds which makes travel to Ethereum possible but tricky. When traveling to Ethereum you partially remain in your current plane but colors fade and travel in three dimensions become possible, along with the ability to fade through objects and becoming untouched by attacks. Some magic is able to bridge this gap between the planes though. The purpose of Ethereum seems to be to protect the planes from colliding with each other, along with other large entities that reside in the [[Cosmology/Sea of Dreams\|Sea of Dreams]]. A barrier of Ethereum also surrounds the [[Cosmology/Sea of Dreams\|Sea of Dreams]] itself, separating the planes within from the [[Cosmology/Far Realms\|Far Realms]].
