<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Items/Items\|Items]] → Spell Splintering</sup></sup>
**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 12th

A *Spell Splintering* weapon allows the user to more easily pierce their foes' spell resistance. The first time each round the weapon damages a creature with spell resistance, that creature’s spell resistance is reduced by 5 for 1 round. This reduction is not cumulative for multiple attacks within the same round, even if the target is struck by different *Spell Splintering* weapons. However, the same creature’s spell resistance can be reduced on multiple rounds by subsequent hits.
