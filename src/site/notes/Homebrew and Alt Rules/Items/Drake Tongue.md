This +1 Longsword depicts a Dragon's head on the guard with its mouth open facing the sword's fuller. It was designed to be wielded by [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who are able to infuse the blade with their breath weapon, enhancing its damage potential.

Upon recovering the daily uses of his breath weapon during a long rest, a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] may expend all three of his uses for the following day into the sword. Doing so causes the Dragon head on the guard to breath energy into the sword's fuller, filling the channel. Drake Tongue then deals additional bonus damage on strike equal to the amount and type of damage that the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn's]] breath weapon deals until the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn's]] next rest (where he may infuse the sword once again). Like all bonus damage (such as the [Flaming](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming) weapon enhancement), it is not multiplied on a critical hit.
