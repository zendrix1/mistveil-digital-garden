This +1 Longsword depicts a Dragon's head on the guard with its mouth open facing the sword's fuller. It was designed to be wielded by [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who are able to infuse the blade with their breath weapon, enhancing its damage potential.

Upon recovering the daily uses of his breath weapon during a long rest, a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] may expend all three of his uses for the following day into the sword. Doing so causes the Dragon head on the guard to breath energy into the sword's fuller, filling the channel. Drake Tongue then deals additional bonus damage on strike equal to the amount and type as the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn's]] breath weapon as if they were two levels lower (minimum 1d6) until the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn's]] next rest (where he may infuse the sword once again). For example, a level 9 [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] has a 5d6 damage breath weapon, so the sword would gain an additional 4d6 damage of the same elemental type. Like all bonus damage (such as the [Flaming](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming) weapon enhancement), it is not multiplied on a critical hit.
