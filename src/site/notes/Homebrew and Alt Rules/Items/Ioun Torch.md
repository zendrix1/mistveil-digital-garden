**Ioun Torch**  
**Price** 75gp  
**Aura** faint universal  
**Weight** -

This item is merely a burned out, dull gray ioun stone with a weakened [*Continual Flame*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/continual-flame/) spell cast upon it. It retains the ability to float and orbit, and allows the bearer to carry light and still have his hands free. It may be in any crystalline shape common to ioun stones (ellipsoid, prism, sphere, and so on). This item emits light out to 40ft but only produces low light.
