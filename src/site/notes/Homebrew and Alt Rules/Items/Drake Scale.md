This +1 Mithral Heavy Steel Shield is made of a special Mithral and Brass alloy that was forged with Dragonfire allowing it to absorb kinetic energy, convert it into magic energy, and release it as deadly flames. Drake Scale was forged for a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] Paladin and so contains a special secondary use as well when the energy is released alongside a charge of [Lay on Hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/CLASSES/CORE-CLASSES/PALADIN/#TOC-Lay-On-Hands-Su-).

Whenever an attack misses the user, Drake Scale gains 1 charge and can hold a maximum of 3 charges at once. The user can, as a standard action, expend any number of charges from the shield in order to release the stored energy in the form of fire dealing 1d6 per two levels (minimum 1d6) the user possesses of fire damage to all creatures in a cone with a size equal to 10ft per charge expended, or in a radius with a size equal to 5ft per charge expended. Any creatures in affected by this ability can make a Reflex saving throw DC 10 + 1/2 the user's level + the user's Charisma modifier to prevent half this damage.

In addition, when wielded by a user capable of using [Lay on Hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/CLASSES/CORE-CLASSES/PALADIN/#TOC-Lay-On-Hands-Su-), charges from Drake Scale can be expended as a part of the swift action used to heal yourself with the ability. Doing so allows you to treat one target per charge expended within 30ft of yourself to also benefit from the same Lay On Hands (using the same roll for all creatures affected).

Note: If, due to an ability such as the [Cover Ally](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/shield#toc5) talent of the [Shield Sphere of Might](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/shield) or similar effect, you are able to cause an attack to miss an ally using the shield, Drake Scale still gains a charge.
