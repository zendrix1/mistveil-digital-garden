Shatterheart is a +2 [Frost](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost/) [Longsword](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword/) that has a decorative blue blade but by speaking the command word and activating the blade as a move action, the blade breaks away leaving just light in the shape of the blade.

While in this form, Shatterheart is a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Enhancement Bonus Requirement\|+0]] [Frost](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost/) [Brilliant Energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/brilliant-energy/) [Longsword](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword/). Activating the sword again causes the metal shards to reform, covering the blade of light, and it returns to its previous form.
