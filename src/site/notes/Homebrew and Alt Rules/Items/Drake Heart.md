This ruby necklace wrapped in golden draconic decorations protects the user against fire and offers the abilities to manipulate flames.

The user gains Fire Resistance 10, Smoke Vision, and Flame Control.

**Smoke Vision (Ex)**
The user can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by [pyrotechnics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pyrotechnics)).

**Flame Control (Su)**
The user can, as a standard action, attempt to move or extinguish any number of 5-foot squares of ongoing non-magical fire. He can effect a total number of 5-foot squares per day equal to his level and chooses how many squares he wants to affect each time he uses this ability. If he chooses to move a portion of the fire, it must be moved to a square contiguous with that fire.

In addition, he may use Flame Control to attempt to dispel a magical fire effect. Doing so costs a number of 5-foot squares equal to the spell level of the magical fire and the user counts his level as his Caster Level for the purpose of the dispel check.
