A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a [bag of holding](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-holding/) and can actually hold material of as much as 2 Bulk in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 10 Bulk of material. Even when so filled, the backpack weighs a negligible amount of Bulk unless you're carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, then its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions), but it does not provoke the [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) that retrieving a stored item usually does.
