<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Items/Items\|Items]] → Dragonglass</sup></sup> 
Dragonglass is a special glass that is made by using the breath weapon of a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] during the glass blowing process. The exact method of doing so is a tradition that is passed down through generations of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] clans within the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]]. The glass is colored the same as the scale color of the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who created it. Dragonglass is commonly used for jewelry or other decorative items but is very durable and could be used to make armor or weapons as well. 

- **HP/inch**: 20
- **Hardness**: 5
- **Cost**: To determine the price of a Dragonglass item, use the original weight but add 25 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.
- **Weight**: 1/2 original item weight.

Dragonglass is so finely made that any items made of it are masterwork quality. Only armor and weapons normally made of metal can be made of Dragonglass.

Light weapons that are made of Dragonglass deal 1 additional point of damage of the same element type as the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] creator's breath weapon type while one-handed and two-handed weapons deal 2 additional points of damage of the same element type.

Light Dragonglass armor grants it's wearer Energy Resistance 1 of the same element type as the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] creator's breath weapon type. Medium and heavy armor grants Energy Resistance 2 of the same type.
