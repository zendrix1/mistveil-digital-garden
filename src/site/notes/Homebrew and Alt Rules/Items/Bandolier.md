**Bandolier**
**Price** 5sp
**Weight** -

This leather belt is worn over one shoulder and runs diagonally across the chest and back. It has small loops or pouches for holding eight objects the size of a flask or small dagger. You can use the “retrieve a stored item” action to take an item from a bandolier expect unlike the normal action, retrieving an item from a bandolier does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity. You can wear up to two bandoliers at the same time (any more than this and they get in each other’s way and restrict your movement).
