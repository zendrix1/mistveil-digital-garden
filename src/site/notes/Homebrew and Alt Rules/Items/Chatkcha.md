These strange three-pointed wedges are used by [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Thri-Kreen\|Thri-Kreen]] hunters in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] as throwing weapons. The chatkcha returns to its thrower on a miss. To catch a returning chatkcha, the character must make an attack roll (as if he were throwing the chatkcha) and hit AC 10. Failure indicates that the weapon falls to the ground 10 feet away from the thrower in a random direction. A non-proficient user who fails in his attempt to catch the chatkcha also suffers 1d4 damage from the weapon's sharp edges.
