**Description**: This heavy vestment is similar to other types of chasuble worn by many clergy over their normal robes and raiment. Although the exact appearance varies, a typical Chasuble of Fell Power is usually crafted from crimson or scarlet cloth, backed by a lining of black silk, and sewn with intricate arcane and eldritch symbols in either gold or silver thread. When this garment is worn by a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]], and the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] uses his [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Eldritch Blast (Su)\|Eldritch Blast]] modified by an [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Invocations (Su)\|invocation]] that allows a saving throw, the wearer gains a bonus of +2 to the save DC (this bonus does not stack with that granted by the [Ability Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/ability-focus/) feat).
