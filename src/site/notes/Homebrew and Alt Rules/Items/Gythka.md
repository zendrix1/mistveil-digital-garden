This polearm, favored by the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Thri-Kreen\|Thri-Kreen]], has razor-sharp slashing blades at both ends. Because of the unique shape of the gythka's blades, it can also be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gythka to avoid being tripped. A gythka is a double weapon. You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
