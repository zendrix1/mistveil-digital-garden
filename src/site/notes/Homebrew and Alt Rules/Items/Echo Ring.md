**Echo Ring**

**CL**: 11th  
**Slot**: Ring  
**Price**: 20,000gp
**Weight**: -

This silver ring depicts a snake curling around your finger to devour its own tail and magically resizes itself to fit on any user. Wearing the ring allows the user to create a semi-real figment of themselves called an Echo for up to 5 rounds per day that do not need to be consecutive. 

As a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity the user may form the Echo in any empty space within 30ft where there is enough room. As part of activating the ring the user gives the Echo one command, which it follow as long as it is able. The Echo acts on the user's turn, including the turn it is created, and maintaining the Echo each turn is a free action however you cannot create another Echo in the same turn that you dismissed your current Echo. The user can, as a move action, switch the command they want their current Echo to follow as well.

The commands an Echo is able to follow are:
- **Attack**: The Echo will attack a target you designate within line of sight. The Echo is capable of using Attacks of Opportunity provoked by this target.
- **Defend**: The Echo will move to a designated space within line of sight as quickly as it is able then attack anything that comes within it's threatened squares. If the Echo is using a ranged weapon, it will instead ready an action to attack anyone within one range increment that moves towards the place it is defending.
- **Move**: The Echo will move to a designated space within line of sight as quickly as it is able or in a way that avoids provoking attacks of opportunity, whichever the user chooses.
- **Swap**: The Echo and the user will both teleport to where the other was previously.
- **Deliver Ability**: The Echo will become the source of the next ability the user activates that would normally originate from the user such as a spell or breath weapon. If the ability requires an attack roll, such as a melee touch attack for a spell, the Echo makes the roll.

The Echo has max HP equal to half the max HP of the user when the ring is activated and is unable to be healed in any way, only restoring back to its max HP after the user rests, recharging the ring back to 5 rounds per day of uses. If the Echo is dismissed and then re-created, it retains any damage it took previously in the day. If the Echo is destroyed and re-created, it appears with 1 hp. 

The Echo has the same AC and attacks as the user but cannot activate any special abilities the user or their equipment may possess. In addition if the Echo is required to make a saving throw, it uses the user's bonuses for those saves. The same is true for things such as CMB and CMD.
