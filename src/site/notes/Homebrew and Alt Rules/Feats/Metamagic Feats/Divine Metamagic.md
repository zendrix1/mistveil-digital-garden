**Prerequisite:** [Channel Energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/Cleric/#Channel_Energy_Su) class feature, any metamagic feat.

**Benefit:** When you take this feat, choose a metamagic feat that you have. This feat applies only to that metamagic feat.

For example, to [Maximize](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/maximize-spell-metamagic/) a divine spell, you would have to spend four uses of Channel Energy to use this feat.
