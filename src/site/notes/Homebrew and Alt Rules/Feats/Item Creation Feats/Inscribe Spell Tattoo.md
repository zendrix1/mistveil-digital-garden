<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Inscribe Spell Tattoo</sup></sup> 
**Prerequisites:** Caster level 1st, 1 rank in [Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft/) or [Spellcraft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft).

**Benefit:** You can create [Spell Tattoos](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-spell) using the item creation rules but you can only inscribe these tattoos on your own body.

**Special:** Spell Tattoos have the same market value of scrolls of the same spell and CL not the default four times the market value.
