<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Imbue Item</sup></sup> 
**Prerequisites**: Deceive Item class feature

**Benefits**: The [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] can use his supernatural power to create magic items, even if he does not know the spells required to make an item (although he must know the appropriate item creation feat). He can substitute a [Use Magic Device](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device/) check (DC 15 + spell level for arcane spells or 20 + spell level for divine spells) in place of a required spell he doesn't know or can't cast. If the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] fails his [Use Magic Device](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device/) check this way he may still use the standard rules for ignoring the spell requirements on items by adding +5 to the [Spellcraft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft) DC to craft the item if he wishes to make any progress on the item that day. Some items like wands and potions do not allow this option however and if the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] fails his [Use Magic Device](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device/) while attempting to make one of these items he does not lose the materials to make the item at first, but the day is wasted and he must wait until the next day to attempt the check again. If the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] fails this check three times in a row while attempting to make a magic item, the materials for the item (usually half the crafting cost or 1/4 base price) and any material components needed are lost.
