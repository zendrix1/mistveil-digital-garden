<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Evolved Companion</sup></sup> 
Your animal companion has abilities that makes it different from others of its kind.

**Prerequisite(s)**: [Animal Companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) class feature.

**Benefit**: Select a 1-point evolution other than pounce or reach from those available to a [summoner’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner) [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon). Your [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) gains this evolution. The [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) must conform to any limitations of the evolution. For instance, only an [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) of an appropriate size and base form can have the mount evolution.

If you gain a new [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions), your old [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) loses this evolution, and you can select a new 1-point evolution for the new [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions).

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select an additional 1-point evolution for your [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions).
