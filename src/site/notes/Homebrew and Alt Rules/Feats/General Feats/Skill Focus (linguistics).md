<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Skill Focus (linguistics)</sup></sup> 
> [!NOTE]
> This is a special addition to the regular Skill Focus feat when selecting the linguistics skill, it is not a separate feat.

**Benefit**: You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving the [linguistics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/linguistics/) skill. If you have 10 or more ranks in that skill, this bonus increases to +6.

In addition when you select this feat, if you are using [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Not in Use/Language Percentages\|Language Percentages]] alternate rules, each of your current languages increase in comprehension by 15% and any future languages you learn begin at 40% comprehension instead of 25%.
