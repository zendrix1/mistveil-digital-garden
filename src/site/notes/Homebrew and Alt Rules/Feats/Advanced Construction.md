<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Advanced Construction</sup></sup>
*You were born with a body made of special materials. Your purpose may be unknown but you are different than most of your siblings.*

**Prerequisites**: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]]

**Benefit**: You are constructed from unusual materials, granting one of the following benefits:

- _Adamantine:_ You gain DR 1/adamantine, and may choose heavy armor as plating (rather than just light or medium armor). Your natural attacks and unarmed strikes count as adamantine for overcoming damage reduction.
- _Cold Iron:_ Your plating's arcane spell failure chance is reduced by -15%. Your natural attacks and unarmed strikes count as cold iron for overcoming damage reduction.
- _Darkwood:_ You gain full benefit from magical healing, and are no longer considered vulnerable to attacks which target metallic or stone creatures.
- _Mithral:_ Your plating counts as one category lighter for determining your speed penalties and whether you can use abilities restricted by armor, such as fast movement (if your plating was light, you count as unarmored for this purpose). Your natural attacks and unarmed strikes count as silver for overcoming damage reduction.

**Special:** You may only select this feat at 1st level.
