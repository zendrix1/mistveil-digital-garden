<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Persona Immersion</sup></sup>
*Your understanding of your own physiology allows you to deceive certain Divination effects.*

Prerequisites: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Changelings\|Changeling]], Mutable Mind and Body racial trait

Benefit: While under the effect of your Minor Shape Change ability, if you make a successful save against a divination spell of 3rd level or lower, you can generate a misleading result. Though you don’t learn the precise spell being used against you, you know what type of information is sought and can respond accordingly. For example, a character with this feat who successfully saves against Detect Thoughts knows that his surface thoughts are being probed, and can thus supply any specific thoughts that he wishes to be detected by the caster.
