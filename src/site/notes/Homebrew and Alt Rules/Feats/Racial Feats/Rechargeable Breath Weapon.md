<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Rechargeable Breath Weapon</sup></sup>
*You have learnt to use your breath weapon many more times each day, with only a short time needed to recharge between uses.*

**Prerequisites**: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], 8 Hit Dice

**Benefit**: Instead of being able to use your breath weapon a number of times per day, you instead can use it At-Will with a recharge of 1d6 rounds which you must wait between uses.

**Special**: If you are a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Silver Dragonborn\|Silver Dragonborn]] or [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Gold Dragonborn\|Gold Dragonborn]], your recharge is 1d8 instead of 1d6.
