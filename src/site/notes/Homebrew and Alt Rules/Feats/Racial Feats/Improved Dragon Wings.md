<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Dragonwrought Kobold</sup></sup>
**Prerequisites**: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Racial Feats/Dragonwrought Kobold\|Dragonwrought Kobold]], hit dice 5.

**Benefit**: You can fly at a speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). You can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. You can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but you must fly a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. You can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. You can use the run action while flying, provided you fly in a straight line.
