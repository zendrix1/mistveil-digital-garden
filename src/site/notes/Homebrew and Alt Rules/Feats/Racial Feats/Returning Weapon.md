<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Returning Weapon</sup></sup>
*Your integrated weapon is bound to you and returns upon being thrown.*

**Prerequisites**: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]], Integrated Weapon racial trait.

**Benefit**: Your integrated weapon is treated as having the [Returning](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/returning/) weapon enhancement when thrown by you. This has no effect on a weapon which cannot be thrown. This does not give the weapon a magical aura nor apply towards the weapon's total enhancement bonus.
