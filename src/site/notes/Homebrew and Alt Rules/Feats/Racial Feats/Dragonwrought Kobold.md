<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Dragonwrought Kobold</sup></sup>
*Ever since your egg was laid it was clear that you were special. You were born not as a distant whelp dreaming of draconic ancestors but as a Dragon yourself.*

**Prerequisites**: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Kobolds\|Kobold]], Dragonwrought racial trait

**Benefit**: Your type changes to Dragon and you gain the Humanoid subtype so you count as a [Humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) _and_ a [Dragon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/) for the purpose of all abilities and effects.

In addition you gain a +2 Natural Armor bonus, the Dragonmaw and Dragon Affinity alternate racial traits, and wings that can aid you in jumping and can be used to glide, negating damage from a fall from any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. You can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If you become unconscious or helpless while in midair, your wings naturally unfurl, and powerful ligaments stiffen them. You descend in a tight corkscrew and take only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall. You gain a +5 bonus to [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Athletics\|Athletics]] skill checks made to jump.
