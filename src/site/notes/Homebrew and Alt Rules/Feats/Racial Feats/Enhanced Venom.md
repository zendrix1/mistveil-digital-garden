<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Feats\|Feats]] → Enhanced Venom</sup></sup>
*Your natural Vishkanya Venom is more potent than others of your race.*

**Prerequisites**: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]], Toxic racial trait.

**Benefit**: The save DC for your Vishkanya Venom uses your total hit dice rather than 1/2, making the save Fort DC 10 + the Vishkanya’s Hit Dice + the Vishkanya’s Constitution modifier. In addition you gain 1 additional use per day of your Toxic racial trait.
