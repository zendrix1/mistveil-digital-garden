<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → Traits</sup></sup> 
When you create your character, ask your GM how many [traits](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/) you can select. In default Mistveil games a new PC can choose up to two [traits](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/) plus up to two bonus [traits](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/) if they take [drawbacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks/) (one bonus trait per [drawback](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks/)). Some GMs may wish to adjust this number somewhat, depending upon their style of play. Even if your GM normally doesn’t allow bonus [traits](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/) at character creation, you might still be able to pick up some with the [Additional Traits](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/additional-traits/) feat. Homebrew traits are highly encouraged as well so work with your GM to make traits that work best for your character and fit your backstory. Below are some examples of homebrew traits used in Mistveil games.

##### Tools of War
**Type**: Equipment
_You've spent a large portion of your life around a forge for an army or other militaristic group, assisting in the creation of armor and weapons. You pressed so many breastplates and hammered out endless swords and as such they have all become part of the same task for you._  
**Benefits**: Whenever using the _Craft_ (Weapons) or _Craft_ (Armor) skill to craft or repair nonmagical weapons or armor, you use whichever of the two has a higher bonus. In addition you get a +2 in one of those two skills, chosen when you take this trait.
