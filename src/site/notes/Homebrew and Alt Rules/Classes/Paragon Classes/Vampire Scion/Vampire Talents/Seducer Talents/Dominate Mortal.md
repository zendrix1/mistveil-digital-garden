**Prerequisite(s)**: Any five Seducer talents, [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Paragon Classes/Vampire Scion/Vampire Talents/Seducer Talents/Charm Mortal\|Charm Mortal]] talent.

**Benefits**: Three times per day, a Vampire with this talent can, as a standard action, attempt to crush the will of one living target within 30ft as per the *[Dominate Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-person)* spell (using the Vampire's level as the caster level) unless they make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + ½ the Vampire's level + the Vampire's Charisma modifier) to resist the effect.

Once the vampire reaches 16th level they can dominate an even wider array of living creatures. This talent now acts as the *[Dominate Monster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-monster/)* spell instead of *[Dominate Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-person)* except the target must still be living.
