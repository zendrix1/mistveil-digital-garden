**Benefits**: A number of times per day equal to 2 plus half the Vampire's level, a Vampire with this talent can beckon the blood around a target's wound to aggressively thin, making the wound profusely bleed. The Vampire's target must be within 25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels of the Vampire and cannot be at full hit points.
