**Prerequisite(s)**: Any one Sanguimancy talent.

**Benefits**: A Vampire with this talent can, as a free action, make it difficult for those around them to perceive their presence, allowing them to go about unnoticed with ease for an number of rounds equal to their level (the rounds do not need to be consecutive). While active this talent allows the Vampire to use the Stealth skill to hide from any creature attempting to perceive them using blindsight or blindsense, even if they are clearly in that creature’s perceptual field. While this talent is active, being difficult to perceive does make social interactions more difficult however, due to the target being unable to focus on the Vampire for more than a few moments, making use of social skills like Bluff and Diplomacy nearly impossible.

Once the Vampire reaches 5th level they are undetectable by scent while this talent is active, at 8th level they are able to use Stealth to hide from creatures with tremorsense, and at 13th level they are able to use the Stealth skill to hide even while being directly observed.
