**Benefits**: Three times per day, a Vampire with this talent can, as a standard action, alter their appearance to make themselves appear like someone else. This acts as the *[Disguise Self](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disguise-self/)* spell (using the Vampire's level for their caster level) except they can appear as any humanoid, not just a creature of their own type, they still cannot change their size category this way however.
