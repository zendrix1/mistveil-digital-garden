**Prerequisite(s)**: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Paragon Classes/Vampire Scion/Vampire Talents/Sanguimancy Talents/Blood Bats\|Blood Bats]] talent.

Benefits: When a Vampire with this talent conjures their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Paragon Classes/Vampire Scion/Vampire Talents/Sanguimancy Talents/Blood Bats\|Blood Bats]], in addition to attack, burst, or distract, they can order them to defend the Vampire. When ordered to defend the bats swarm around the Vampire, obscuring his form and protecting him from sunlight temporarily. This talent acts as the *[Cloak of Shadows](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cloak-of-shadows/)* spell with a caster level equal the Vampire's level.

Even with this magical protection, moving through the sunlight is not easy for the Vampire however, and they are considered fatigued for the duration of their exposure.
