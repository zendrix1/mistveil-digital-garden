**Prerequisite(s)**: Any seven Sanguimancy talents.

**Benefits**: Twice per day, a Vampire with this talent can shoot a black ray of necromantic energy from their outstretched hand, causing their foe to violently purge blood vessels through its skin. The purged blood vessels spread outward, creating a many-layered mass of bloody, adhesive tissue that traps nearby creatures in gore as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to the Vampire's level.

The Vampire must succeed on a ranged touch attack with a range of 25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels to strike a target. If the attack is successful, the subject loses half its total hit points (rounded down) and is stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + ½ the Vampire's level + the Vampire's Charisma modifier), the subject is not stunned.

The Avascular Mass instantaneously erupts from the subject and must be anchored to at least two opposed points—such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls—or else the mass collapses and has no effect. Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius of Avascular Mass become entangled. The original target is automatically entangled. Because the Avascular Mass is magically animate and gradually tightens on those it holds, an entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 25 Concentration check or lose the spell.

Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + ½ the Vampire's level + the Vampire's Charisma modifier). If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the Avascular Mass and is free to act, though moving might be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.

If you have at least 5 feet of Avascular Mass between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of Avascular Mass between you, it provides total cover.

The Avascular Mass of entangling tissue persists for 1 round per Vampire level. When the duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes limp, decaying tissue.

A creation without blood vessels or similar anatomical structure is not affected by Avascular Mass.
