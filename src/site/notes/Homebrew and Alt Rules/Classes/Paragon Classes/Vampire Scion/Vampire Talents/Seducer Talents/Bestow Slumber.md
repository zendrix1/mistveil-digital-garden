**Benefits**: A Vampire with this talent can, as a standard action, breath out a cloud of toxic gas that causes a creature within 15 feet to fall into a deep, magical sleep, as per the spell *[Sleep](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep)*. The creature receives a Fortitude save (DC 10 + ½ the Vampire's level + the Vampire's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep for a number of rounds equal to the Vampire's level.

This talent can affect a creature of any HD. The creature will not wake due to noise or light, but others can rouse it with a standard action. This talent ends immediately if the creature takes damage. Once affected, a creature cannot be the target of this talent again for 24 hours.
