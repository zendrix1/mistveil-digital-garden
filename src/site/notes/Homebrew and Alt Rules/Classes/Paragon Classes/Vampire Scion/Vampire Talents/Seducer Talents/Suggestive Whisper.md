**Prerequisite(s)**: Any two Seducer talents.

**Benefits**: An amount of times per day equal to 1/3 their level rounded down (minimum 1), a Vampire with this talent can, as a standard action, whisper a command into the ear of an adjacent target, compelling them to follow your orders unless they make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + ½ the Vampire's level + the Vampire's Charisma modifier), as per the *[Suggestion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion/)* spell (using the Vampire's level as the caster level).

Once the Vampire reaches 12th level, his whispers can travel from ear to ear across a room, affecting a number of creatures equal to 1 per level with the same suggestion as long as no two targets are more than 30ft from each other, as per the *[Mass Suggestion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion/)* spell.
