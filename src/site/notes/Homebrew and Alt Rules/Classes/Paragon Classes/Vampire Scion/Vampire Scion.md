<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Classes\|Classes]] → Vampire Scion</sup></sup>
> [!NOTE] Note
> This class needs more work. It's mostly playable as is but I'd consider it to be in an "Alpha" state at the moment. The intention is to take the traits of a vampire and spread it out so a player can start as a vampire at level 1 without breaking the game. It is difficult to balance though because it is suppose to be more powerful than traditional classes due to its rarity and lore.

*"You speak to me as my elder; if only you knew how many of your pathetic lives I've lived, you might be able to grasp the danger you are in right now."*

The dark powers of undeath are sought after by some and feared by many more. Some are infected after a brutal experience with a monster, some delve into dark ruins and wild jungles of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] trying to pursue this avenue of strength, but all who acquire these dark powers must train if they wish to hone them and become more powerful and those who do are referred to as Scions.

[[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Paragon Classes/Vampire Scion/Vampire Talents/Vampire Talents\|The complete list of Vampire Talents]]
<br>
##### Vampiric Resistances (Ex)
The undead bodies of Vampires have been toughened by their transformation and the supernatural power of the [[Tainted Blood\|Tainted Blood]] that flows through their veins. 

Starting at 2nd level, the Vampire gains DR 2/Magic and Silver, Fast Healing 1, and Resistance to Cold 5 and Electricity 5.

At 5th level, the Vampire gains Channel Resistance +1. This resistance increases by +1 at level 10 and every 5 levels thereafter until +4 at level 20. In addition the Vampire's Fast Healing increases to Fast Healing 2.

At 8th level, the Vampire's damage reduction increases to DR 5/Magic and Silver and their Fast Healing increases to Fast Healing 3.

At 11th level, the Vampire's Resistances to Cold and Electricity increase to 10 each.

At 14th level, the Vampire's damage reduction changes to DR 10/Magic and their Fast Healing increases to Fast Healing 4.

<br>
##### Bonus Feat
Starting at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the Vampire gains a bonus feat from the following list.

- [Alertness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/alertness)
- [Combat Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-reflexes-combat)
- [Dodge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dodge-combat)
- [Improved Initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-initiative-combat)
- [Lightning Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/lightning-reflexes)
- [Toughness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/toughness)
<br>
##### Fast Movement (Ex)
At 3rd level, the Vampire gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table: Vampire Scion. A Vampire in medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. 
<br>
##### Natural Armor (Ex)
At 3rd level, the Vampire gains Natural Armor of 1 and increases as they increase in level as shown on Table: Vampire Scion.
<br>
##### Spider Climb (Ex)
At 3rd level, a Vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a [*Spider Climb*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spider-climb) spell. This is a physical ability, not spell-like so it cannot be dispelled and functions while inside of an anti-magic field.
<br>
##### Claws (Ex)
At 4th level, the Vampire gains the ability to grow and retract their fingernails. While extended, these blade like nails act as claws and the Vampire gains two natural Claw attacks. The claws deal damage appropriate to the Vampire's size category (medium claw attacks deal 1d4 damage, refer to the [Improved Natural Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/improved-natural-attack/) chart for dice progression).
<br>
##### Enhanced Body and Mind (Ex)
At 5th level, the Vampire's body and senses have continued to become strengthened under the influence of the [[Tainted Blood\|Tainted Blood]]. They gain a +1 bonus to each of their five ability scores that are gained as if through level advancement. At 14th level, this bonus increases to +2. 
<br>
##### Gaseous Form (Su)
At 5th level, as a standard action, the Vampire can assume a [*Gaseous Form*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form/) at will (caster level 5th) as the spell of the same name, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the Vampire assumes their gaseous form. It must reach a safe place within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to the Vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing with their Fast Healing ability.
<br>
##### Read the Blood (Su)
At 7th level, the Vampire has tasted the blood of many and has learnt how to divine some information from the life force they are consuming. Whenever the Vampire successfully uses their Drain Blood ability on a creature, the Vampire is able to read the creature's surface thoughts from the recent past, absorbing 5 minutes of surface thoughts per point of constitution damage dealt. This ability works similarly to the 3rd round of the _[Detect Thoughts](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts/)_ spell except the victim does not receive a saving throw to prevent this effect.
<br>
##### Sanguine Lord (Su)
At 20th level, the Vampire has learned how to truly tap into the [Tainted Blood] and once per day assume their Sanguine Lord form. While in this form the Vampire's appearance becomes much more beastial and bat-like and they gain the following traits.

- Wings erupt form the Vampire's back, giving two Wing secondary natural attacks and a fly speed of 60ft with perfect maneuverability. The wings are treated as secondary natural weapons, allowing you to attack with them at a -5 penalty along with your other attacks. These attacks deal damage appropriate to the Vampire's size category (medium wing attacks deal 1d4 damage, refer to the [Improved Natural Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/improved-natural-attack/) chart for dice progression). plus 1/2 of your Strength modifier.
