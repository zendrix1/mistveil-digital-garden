<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] â†’ Classes</sup></sup>

> [!NOTE] Note
> Although true with all homebrew on this site, it is worth noting that the homebrew classes are specifically subject to change. Consider each of these in a "beta" state and in need of playtesting and, likely, nerfs (I believe in starting strong and working down rather than the opposite)
