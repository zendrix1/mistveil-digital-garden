While entering your Beast Dance, [[Leylines\|Leyline]] energy collects at the tips of your fingers and forms into the shape of long claws used for burrowing through earth or for use in combat.

When gaining this aspect you and your Bonded Companion each gain claws. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. The claws deal damage appropriate to your and your companion's size category (medium claw attacks deal 1d4 damage, refer to the [Improved Natural Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/improved-natural-attack/) chart for dice progression).

If you or your Bonded Companion already have a claw attack, treat the damage of it as if it was one size category higher.

In addition, while you have this aspect, you and your Bonded Companion gain a burrow speed based on the Beast Dancer's level to move through dirt and loose earth however you cannot move through solid stone.
