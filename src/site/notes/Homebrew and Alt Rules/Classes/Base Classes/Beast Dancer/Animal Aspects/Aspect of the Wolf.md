While entering your Beast Dance, [[Leylines\|Leyline]] energy sharpens your senses along with your teeth, allowing you to find weakness easier in vulnerable enemies along with dangerous fangs.

When gaining this aspect you and your Bonded Companion each gain a bite attack. This bite attack is treated as a primary natural weapon. The bite deals damage appropriate to your and your companion's size category (medium bite attacks deal 1d6 damage, refer to the [Improved Natural Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/improved-natural-attack/) chart for dice progression).

If you or your Bonded Companion already have a bite attack, treat the damage of it as if it was one size category higher.

In addition, while you have this aspect active, you and your Bonded Companion gain an additional +1 bonus to attacks and damage while flanking your foes (this bonus stacks with effects such as the [Outflank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/outflank-combat-teamwork/) feat).

At 8th level the bonuses to attack and damage increase to +2 and finally at 16th level the bonuses increase to +3.
