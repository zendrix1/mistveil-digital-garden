While entering your Beast Dance, [[Leylines\|Leyline]] energy erupts from your back in the form of feathered wings and sharpens into brutal talons around your feet.

When gaining this aspect you and your Bonded Companion each gain talons. These talons are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two talon attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. The talons deal damage appropriate to your and your companion's size category (medium talon attacks deal 1d6 damage, refer to the [Improved Natural Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/improved-natural-attack/) chart for dice progression).

If you or your Bonded Companion already have a talon attack, treat the damage of it as if it was one size category higher.

In addition, while you have this aspect, you and your Bonded Companion gain a fly speed based on the Beast Dancer's level.
