While entering your Beast Dance, [[Leylines\|Leyline]] energy collects at the corners of your mouth in the shape of razor sharp tusks.

When gaining this aspect you and your Bonded Companion each gain a gore attack. The gore is treated as a primary natural weapon, and can be used alongside a bite because, even though both are on the same limb (the head), they use different body parts (see the [Gargoyle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/gargoyle/) for an example of this). The gore deals piercing damage appropriate to your and your companion's size category (medium gore attacks deal 1d6 damage, refer to the [Improved Natural Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/improved-natural-attack/) chart for dice progression).

If you or your Bonded Companion already have a gore attack, treat the damage of it as if it was one size category higher.

In addition, while you have this aspect, you and your Bonded Companion gain a special version of the [Charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Charge) full-round action. While under the effects of Aspect of the Boar and Charging, the Beast Dancer and her Bonded Companion may make a gore attack as a free action after finishing their movement to their target. This attack is made with their full base attack bonus (plus any other normal bonuses such as from the charge itself) and uses 1-1/2 times their Strength bonus on damage. They can still use their gore attack as a part of their normal attack action at the end of the charge as well.
