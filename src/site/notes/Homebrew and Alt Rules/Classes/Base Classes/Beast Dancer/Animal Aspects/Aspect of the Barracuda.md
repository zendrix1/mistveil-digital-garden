While entering your Beast Dance, [[Leylines\|Leyline]] energy wraps gently around your neck and feet in the shape of gills and fins respectively.

When gaining this aspect, you and your Bonded Companion each gain a special charge attack that can only be used while in water that is deep enough to use a swim speed in. When the Beast Dancer or her Bonded Companion makes a charge attack this way, they gain +10ft to their movement speed during the charge and their melee weapons and natural weapons deal damage as if they were [one size category larger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#TOC-Weapon-Qualities) than they actually are.

In addition, while you have this aspect active, you and your Bonded Companion each gain the ability to breathe water freely (this does not make you unable to breathe air) and a swim speed based on the Beast Dancer's level.
