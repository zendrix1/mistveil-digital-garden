While entering your Beast Dance, [[Leylines\|Leyline]] energy builds around your lower legs and feet, forming into the shape of large elongated paws.

When gaining this aspect you and your Bonded Companion each act as if under the effects of the *[Jump](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/j/jump/)* and *[Haste](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste/)* spells as long as you continue to Beast Dance using your level in Beast Dancer as your caster level for the purpose of the Acrobatics bonus from *[Jump](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/j/jump/)*. These bonuses are not magical and cannot be dispelled as such.

At 8th level, the bonus to your movement speeds from the *[Haste](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste/)* effect increases to 40ft.

At 16th level, the *[Haste](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste/)* effect is replaced by the Mythic version of the spell.
