<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Classes\|Classes]] → Beast Dancer</sup></sup>
Most Druids are able to tap into the magic of [[Leylines\|Leylines]] to take the shape of animals, but other users of Sylvan magic are able to more acutely feel how that power flows through all living things. By focusing on that flow they learn to enhance and fight alongside their animal companion to a greater degree. The majestic movements between their companion and themselves has been compared to a dance, garnering these warriors the name of Beast Dancers.

### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Beast Dancer.
<br>
##### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Beast Dancers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons.

Beast Dancers are proficient with light armor and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. The Beast Dancer may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel.

Beast Dancers are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.

Beast Dancers who wear prohibited armor or use prohibited shields are unable to cast spells or use any of their supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
<br>
##### Blended Training
Whenever the Beast Dancer would gain a magic talent from her class levels (not the 2 bonus talents gained when first gaining the casting class feature), she may instead gain a combat talent. the Beast Dancer uses her casting ability modifier as her practitioner modifier. 
<br>
##### Bonded Companion (Ex)
At 1st level, the Beast Dancer gains the Beastmastery sphere as a bonus sphere. She must select the (handle animal) package. If she already possesses the Beastmastery sphere, but not the (handle animal) package, she gains that package, and if that package is already possessed, she gains a talent from that sphere as a bonus talent. The Beast Dancer uses her class level as her base attack bonus with this sphere to determine its effects, but not for attack rolls.

The Beast Dancer also gains the animal companion talent of the Beastmastery sphere, and uses her Beast Dancer level as her druid class level for her animal companion (instead of BAB, Handle Animal, or Ride - 3). She may choose a martial beast animal companion if desired.

The Beast Dancer may teach her companion [hunter’s tricks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/archetypes/paizo-ranger-archetypes/skirmisher) from the skirmisher ranger archetype instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.

If the Beast Dancer releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished. 
<br>
##### Casting
The Beast Dancer may combine [spheres and talents](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/) to create magical effects. The Beast Dancer is considered a Mid-Caster. She must use her Wisdom as her casting ability modifier. (Note: all casters gain 2 bonus talents and may select a casting tradition the first time they gain the casting class feature.) 
<br>
##### Spell Pool
The Beast Dancer gains a small reservoir of energy she can call on to create truly wondrous effects, called a spell pool. This pool contains a number of spell points equal to her level + her casting ability modifier (minimum: 1). This pool replenishes once per day after roughly 8 hours of rest. 
<br>
##### Improved Empathic Link (Su)
The Beast Dancer gains an empathic link with her Bonded Companion. This functions like an empathic link with a [familiar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-), except the Beast Dancer can also see through a companion’s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The Beast Dancer is blinded while maintaining this connection. 
<br>
##### Nature Training (Ex)
The Beast Dancer counts her total Beast Dancer level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion. 
<br>
##### Wild Empathy (Ex)
The Beast Dancer can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The Beast Dancer rolls 1d20 and adds her Beast Dancer level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the Beast Dancer and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The Beast Dancer can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check. 
<br>
##### Beast Dance (Su)
At 2nd level, the Beast Dancer lives up to their title by truly being able to fight as one creature with their Bonded Companion. Whenever the Beast Dancer uses her Improved Empathic Link to see through her companion's eyes while within 30ft of her companion she can choose to start a Beast Dance. While under the effects of Beast Dance, the Beast Dancer does not suffer the negative effects of being blinded by the Improved Emphatic Link.

During a Beast Dance the Beast Dancer's Bonded Companion counts as having any [Teamwork Feats](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats/) that the Beast Dancer has, they do not need to meet the prerequisites for the feats. In addition the Beast Dancer and her Bonded Companion can take simultaneous movement actions during a Beast Dance. For example, the Beast Dancer can move behind an enemy and their Bonded Companion can move in front of them in order to flank before either of them takes their standard actions to attack. Alternately, the Beast Dancer can move partially, have their companion move, then finish their movement afterwards for example.

When starting a new Beast Dance, the Beast Dancer may choose up to one [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Beast Dancer/Beast Dancer#Animal Aspect\|Animal Aspect]] and one [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Beast Dancer/Beast Dancer#Nature Form\|Nature Form]] they have to be active for it's duration.

This ability lasts a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Wisdom modifier that do not need to be consecutive. If the Beast Dancer gets farther than 30ft from her companion while under the effects of Beast Dance the effect immediately ends and both become stunned for 1 turn. The Beast Dancer can maintain their Beast Dance as a free action at the beginning of any turn after they active the ability. 
<br>
##### Animal Aspect
Starting at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the Beast Dancer may choose one Animal Aspect from the list of options to add to her available abilities when starting a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Beast Dancer/Beast Dancer#Beast Dance (Su)\|Beast Dance]].

[[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Beast Dancer/Animal Aspects/Animal Aspects\|List of Animal Aspects ]]
<br>
##### Teamwork Feat
At 3rd level the Beast Dancer gains a bonus [teamwork feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats/) in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The Beast Dancer must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus [teamwork feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats/). 
<br>
##### Nature Form
Starting at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the Beast Dancer may choose one Nature Form from the list of options to add to her available abilities when starting a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Beast Dancer/Beast Dancer#Beast Dance (Su)\|Beast Dance]].

[[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Beast Dancer/Nature Forms/Nature Forms\|List of Nature Forms]] 
<br>
##### Alter Companion Size (Su)
At 6th level, the Beast Dancer gains the ability to focus the magic of the Leylines that flow through their Bonded Companion to change its size. By spending a full-round action while touching their companion, the Beast Dancer can change their size up to one category larger or smaller than their base size (many 4th or 7th level advancements will change the base size). Any barding or other gear worn by their companion changes size with them. The Bonded Companion cannot become larger than Huge or smaller than Tiny with this ability.

At 13th level, the Bonded Companion can change up to two size categories from their base size, although the maximum and minimum size categories remain.

This ability acts as the *[Enlarge Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/enlarge-person/)* and *[Reduce Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reduce-person/)* spells except that it is not a magical effect and has no duration. When using this ability to change size categories by two stages, refer to the mythic versions of both spells.

Bonded Companions use regular [size modifiers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/space-reach-threatened-area-templates?/#Creature_Sizes) rules, [carrying capacity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/carrying-capacity/) for larger and smaller creatures rules, and [damage dice based on size](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/space-reach-threatened-area-templates?/#Creature_Sizes) rules when changing size. 

##### Draped in Hides (Ex)
Although still prohibited from wearing metal armor, the Beast Dancer has spent most of their life using heavy animal hides and other natural materials such as wood and bark to both protect them from the elements as well as protect them in combat. Over time, training and living with these materials has allowed the Beast Dancer to move more freely within them, causing her to take no penalties to movement for wearing medium armor that is not made of metal starting at 6th level.

At 8th level, the Beast Dancer's comfort in heavier armor has grown even further. Anytime she is wearing light or medium armor that is not made of metal, reduce the armor check penalty by 1 (minimum 0). 
<br>
##### Greater Empathic Link (Su)
At 14th level, the range of the Beast Dancer’s empathic link with her Bonded Companion increases to 10 miles. If the companion is within 1 mile, the Beast Dancer can communicate with it telepathically. 
<br>
##### As One (Su)
At 20th level, the Beast Dancer is so entuned with their Bonded Companion that they no longer have any limitation on how long they can stay in a Beast Dance, letting them start and maintain the ability at-will. In addition, when entering a Beast Dance the Beast Dancer can choose two of their Nature Forms and Animal Aspects to use instead of only one each.
