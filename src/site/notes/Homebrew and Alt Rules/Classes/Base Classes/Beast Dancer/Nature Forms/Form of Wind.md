As you enter your Beast Dance alongside your Bonded Companion, you channel the power of the [[Leylines\|Leylines]] flowing around you into the form of speeding winds and cloak your weapons and natural weapons with it, causing them to strike more quickly and more often.

When entering this form you choose one weapon or natural weapon type to add the effect to for both yourself and your Bonded Companion. When attacking with the weapon you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll per four levels the Beast Dancer has (+2 at level 8, +3 at level 12, etc) and gain an additional attack with the weapon when making a full-attack (similar to the [Speed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed) enhancement).
