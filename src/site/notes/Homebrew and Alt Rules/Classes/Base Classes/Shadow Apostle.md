### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Shadow Apostle.
<br>
##### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
The Shadow Apostle is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. She is proficient with light armor but not with shields. A Shadow Apostle is also proficient with the favored weapon of her deity. 
<br>
##### Spellcasting
A Shadow Apostle casts divine spells drawn from the [Inquisitor spell list](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-inquisitor/). She can cast any spell she knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.

To learn or cast a spell, a Shadow Apostle must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a Shadow Apostle’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the Shadow Apostle’s Wisdom modifier.

A Shadow Apostle can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on the table below. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/BASICS-ABILITY-SCORES/ability-scores/#Abilities_and_Spellcasters)).

A Shadow Apostle’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A Shadow Apostle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the Shadow Apostle’s choice. At each new Shadow Apostle level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on the table below. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a Shadow Apostle knows is not affected by her Wisdom score.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third Shadow Apostle level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a Shadow Apostle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the Shadow Apostle “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level Shadow Apostle spell she can cast. The Shadow Apostle may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.

##### Channel Energy (Su)
Regardless of alignment, any Shadow Apostle can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.

A good Shadow Apostle (or a neutral Shadow Apostle who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil Shadow Apostle (or a neutral Shadow Apostle who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral Shadow Apostle of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the Shadow Apostle. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage. Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Shadow Apostle’s level + the Shadow Apostle’s Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A Shadow Apostle may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A Shadow Apostle can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.

A Shadow Apostle may use this ability without presenting her holy symbol, but it must be on her person. 
<br>
##### Domain
Like a cleric’s deity, a Shadow Apostle’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, and her values. Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, a Shadow Apostle must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. A Shadow Apostle can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity or one of the following domains; [Trickery](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/trickery-domain/), [Charm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/charm-domain/), or [Darkness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/darkness-domain/) domain. Even if her deity does not hold dominion over these areas, the Shadow Apostle is able to channel their divine power in these ways in order to better serve her deity from the shadows. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain.

Each domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the Shadow Apostle. A Shadow Apostle adds the bonus spells listed for her domain to her Spells Known but does not gain bonus spell slots like the cleric. The Shadow Apostle uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the Shadow Apostle has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as a Shadow Apostle. Levels of cleric and Shadow Apostle stack for the purpose of determining domain powers and abilities.
<br>
##### Finesse Training (Ex)
At 1st level, a Shadow Apostle gains [Weapon Finesse](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-finesse-combat/) as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the Shadow Apostle from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The Shadow Apostle can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.
<br>
##### Orisons
Shadow Apostles can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Shadow Apostle Spells Per Day. These spells are treated like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. 
<br>
##### Sneak Attack
If a Shadow Apostle can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The Shadow Apostle’s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a Shadow Apostle can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.

The Shadow Apostle must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A Shadow Apostle cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.

##### Sacred Stealth (Su)
A Shadow Apostle can channel some of her divine power to become stealthier. To do this, she must lose a number of her Channel Energy uses. She gains a sacred bonus on Stealth checks for a number of minutes equal to the number of Channel uses used for this ability. The bonus to her Stealth checks is equal to half her Shadow Apostle level rounded down (minimum 1).

Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

##### Shadowbane Power
Starting at 2nd level and every two class levels afterwards a Shadow Apostle has the chance to enhance her existing abilities or gain a new one. Each time a Shadow Apostle gains this ability she can choose to increase her Channel Energy or Sneak Attack dice by 1d6 up to a maximum of half her total level plus one.

Alternatively, a Shadow Apostle can forgo the increase to her existing abilities to gain a Rogue Talent or, after reaching level 12, an Advanced Rogue Talent.

##### Silent Spell

<br>
##### Discover Subterfuge (Ex)
A Shadow Apostle trains diligently to detect subterfuge and the misdirection of others. At 4th level and higher, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks. This bonus increases to +3 at 7th level and +4 at 10th level. 
<br>
##### Shadow’s Edge (Ex)
At 5th level, a Shadow Apostle has mastered a single skill beyond that skill’s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well. 
<br>
##### Divine Metamagic
At 6th level, A Shadow Apostle gains the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Metamagic Feats/Divine Metamagic\|Divine Metamagic]] feat as a bonus feat. 
<br>
##### Bane (Su)
At 7th level, a Shadow Apostle can imbue one of her weapons with the [Bane weapon special ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/bane/) as a swift action. She must select one creature type when she uses this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is humanoid or outsider). Once selected, the type can be changed as a swift action. This ability only functions while the Shadow Apostle wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it is returned to the Shadow Apostle before the duration expires. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the Shadow Apostle’s level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. 
<br>
##### Sacred Defense (Su)
At 9th level and higher, a Shadow Apostle can channel some of her divine power to help her avoid the attacks of enemies. To do this, she must lose a number of her Channel Energy uses. The Shadow Apostle gains a sacred bonus to Armor Class for a number of rounds equal to the number of Channel uses used for this ability plus her Charisma modifier. The bonus to her Armor Class is equal to half her Charisma modifier rounded down (minimum 1).

At 15th level, the bonus to Armor Class increases from half of her Charisma modifier to her entire modifier.

Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. 
<br>
##### Stalwart (Ex)
At 13th level, a Shadow Apostle can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the Shadow Apostle is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless Shadow Apostle does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability. 
<br>
##### Divine Strike (Su)
Upon reaching 20th level, a Shadow Apostle becomes incredibly deadly when sneak attacking. Each time the Shadow Apostle successfully makes a sneak attack, she can choose to deal twice the damage dealt by her channel energy ability, or force the target (if it is an outsider) to become subject to *[Banishment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/banishment/)*, using her Shadow Apostle level as the caster level.

Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the Shadow Apostle’s level + the Shadow Apostle’s Charisma modifier) for half damage or the appropriate save to negate the banishment effect. Once a creature has been the target of a divine strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that Shadow Apostle’s divine strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to sneak attack damage from this ability, but not the channeled energy damage.
