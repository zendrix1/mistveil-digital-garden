### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Dragonfire Sharpshooter.
<br>
##### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Dragonfire Sharpshooters are proficient with all simple weapons, firearms, and light armor. 
<br>
##### Draconic Inspiration (Su)
Dragonfire Sharpshooters can call upon a pool of draconic energy that resides within them to take on certain draconic traits themselves or confer them to their Dragonfire Cannon once they are able to construct it. The maximum number of Inspiration points a Sharpshooter can have is equal to half his level + his Int mod (minimum 1). At the start of each day, the Sharpshooter regains a number of Inspiration points equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). His Inspiration goes up or down throughout the day, though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. The Sharpshooter spends Inspiration to gain Essence (see below), and regains Inspiration in the following ways.

- Critical Hit with his Dragonfire Cannon: Each time the Dragonfire Sharpshooter confirms a critical hit with his Dragonfire Cannon, he regains 1 Inspiration point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the Sharpshooter’s character level does not restore Inspiration.

- Killing Blow with his Dragonfire Cannon: When the Dragonfire Sharpshooter reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with his Dragonfire Cannon while in the heat of combat, he regains 1 Inspiration point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the Sharpshooter’s character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any Inspiration.

##### Dragonfire Ordnance (Su)
A Dragonfire Sharpshooter is adept at using his Draconic powers to infuse his ammunition with volatile magicks. When loading a firearm, he can infuse the ammunition as a free action. The energies are unstable, and if not fired within a number of rounds equal to the Sharpshooter’s Intelligence modifier (though no sooner than the end of his next turn), the Ordnance becomes inert and loses its additional effects; he can still fire the firearm as normal. Each day, the Sharpshooter can infuse a number of pieces of Ordnance equal to half his class level + his Intelligence modifier, and he can fire no more than one piece per round normally.

Dragonfire Ordnance deals damage as normal, plus an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 + the Sharpshooter’s Intelligence modifier. The damage of the Sharpshooter’s Ordnance increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered class level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). The explosive nature of Dragonfire Ordnance causes the attack— both the firearm’s base damage and the Ordnance’s additional damage—to deal full damage to swarms of any size.

The Dragonfire Sharpshooter’s Ordnance functions safely only in weapons he wields. If anyone but the Sharpshooter attempts to fire a firearm loaded with Dragonfire Ordnance that is not yet inert, the firearm’s misfire value increases by 4. If the firearm would explode as the result of such a misfire, the explosion deals additional fire damage equal to that of the Ordnance.

##### Draconic Aspect (Su)
By spending points from their Draconic Inspiration pool, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter can manifest the inherent power that runs through his veins and take on aspects of a dragon for a short time or transfer that power to their Dragonfire Cannon once they have crafted it. Using multiple points at a time can sometimes enhance the abilities as well. A Dragonfire Sharpshooter gains an Draconic Aspect at level 1 then an additional Draconic Aspects at level 4 and each 4 levels afterwards.

###### *Eyes of the Dragon*
Starting at 1st level, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter can channel their draconic energy into their eyes to improve their vision and make them more accurate while firing their firearms at farther ranges than normal. By spending a point from their Draconic Inspiration pool  as a swift action you can make firearm attacks against touch AC out to 2 range increments instead of just one. For each additional point spent while activating this ability the range increment maximum for touch attacks also goes up by one. The effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the Draconic Knowledge points spent to activate it. At 5th level, when the Dragonfire Sharpshooter activates this ability he gains dark vision and low-light vision with a range of 30ft for the duration of this ability. For each additional point spent on this ability, the vision range increases by 10ft. If he already has one or both of these abilities, Eyes of the Dragon increases their base range instead. At 10th level these vision abilities become stronger and the range changes to the maximum range of his Dragonfire Cannon.

###### *Roar of the Dragon*
Starting at 4th level, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter can bottle up their draconic energy then unleash it through the barrel of their firearm while shooting it. The condensed energy escapes the barrel of the firearm like a dragon’s roar and can hurt the hearing of those the Sharpshooter targets or even frighten those near him. When the Sharpshooter activates this ability as a swift action and fires his firearm in the same round, the Sharpshooter gains a Frightful Presence with a range of 20ft that uses his Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma to determine the Will saving throw DC. For each additional Inspiration point spent when activating this ability, the range of this ability increases by 5ft and the Sharpshooter’s HD are considered 1 higher for the purpose of determining who the Frightful Presence can affect and the Will saving throw DC. This ability last's for 1d6 rounds per point of inspiration spent on it to a maximum of 3d6 rounds. At 7th level the Dragonfire Sharpshooter is able to make the blast of energy even stronger, potentially damaging the hearing of those who are too close to him, friend or foe. Anyone within 10ft of the Sharpshooter when this ability is activated must make a Fortitude saving throw with a DC 10 + half the Sharpshooter’s level + his Intelligence modifier or be dazzled and deafened for one minute. On a successful save they are dazzled for 1 round. In addition the max duration of this ability is increased to 4d6. At 11th level the Dragonfire Sharpshooter can target the destructive sound towards his intended targets. He no longer affects allies with his Roar of the Dragon ability. In addition the max duration of this ability is increased to 5d6.

###### *Teeth of the Dragon*
Starting at 8th level, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter becomes capable of infusing multiple ammo cartridges with his Dragonfire Ordnance in one round. By spending a point from his Inspiration pool as a swift action, the Sharpshooter can infuse the second attack that is a part of a full-attack with his Ordnance. When activating this ability, the Sharpshooter can spend multiple points of Inspiration to infuse more attacks with his Ordnance as well. Extra attacks from the Underbarrel Cannon Upgrade or other source of extra attacks such as the Speed weapon enhancement or Haste spell cannot be infused with Dragonfire Ordnance using this ability.

###### *Breath of the Dragon*
At 12th level the Dragonfire Sharpshooter has learnt to infuse his ammunition with especially unstable draconic energy when preparing his Dragonfire Ordnance. By spending a point from his Inspiration pool and a use of his Dragonfire Ordnance, as a standard action the Sharpshooter can cause the cartridge to explode outward as soon as it leaves the barrel of his firearm. The shrapnel and dragonfire explode outward in a 20ft cone originating from the Sharpshooter. Each target in the area takes damage as if they were shot normally with the Sharpshooter’s firearm and Ordnance unless they make a reflex saving throw DC 10 + half the Sharpshooter’s level + his Intelligence modifier to prevent half the damage. By spending additional Inspiration points he can increase the area of effect by 5ft and increase the saving throw DC by 1 for each additional point spent but no more than 4 additional points can be spent this way. At 14th level the Dragonfire Sharpshooter has mastered the timing of the unstable energies he is able to infuse into his ammunition. By spending an additional point of Inspiration while activating Breath of the Dragon, the Sharpshooter can choose the point of origin for the cone attack to be anywhere within his firearm’s first range increment. The cone must still expand away from the Sharpshooter however.

###### *Wings of the Dragon*
Starting at 16th level, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter can channel their draconic energy through their body, causing two ethereal dragon wings to sprout from their back. These wings allow the Sharpshooter to sense even the most minute of differences across the battlefield and react accordingly. By spending a point from their Draconic Inspiration pool as a swift action, the Sharpshooter gains blindsense 60 ft. for one minute. In addition these ethereal wings can make incredibly fine movements so to supernaturally reposition a shot from the Sharpshooter’s firearm in midair, allowing the Sharpshooter to fire at any target that he senses (but does not see), even if there is no direct angle in which the shot could hit. The Sharpshooter may use another point of draconic inspiration as a free action over the duration to ignore the concealment chance for any one enemy they fire at. Alternatively, the Sharpshooter can use these wings to protect themselves, causing the wings to furl inward to protect the Sharpshooter and respond to incoming attacks as well. The Sharpshooter gains +4 natural armor, a +4 resistance bonus to saving throws, and an energy resistance of 10 to all elements for one minute. This energy resistance improves any natural sources the Sharpshooter has but does not stack with any magical effects from spells or items. The Sharpshooter may use another point of draconic inspiration while activating this ability to gain the effect of Freedom of Movement, as the spell of the same name for the duration of the ability.

###### *Form of the Dragon*
At 20th level the Dragonfire Sharpshooter has come to the ultimate understanding of the draconic energy that flows through him. By spending a point from his Inspiration pool as a swift action, the Sharpshooter takes the form of a huge dragon, merging with his Dragonfire Cannon in the process. This ability functions as the Form of the Dragon III spell except whenever you activate your breath weapon you may choose to spend a point from your Inspiration pool to infuse your breath weapon with Dragonfire Ordnance. In addition any critical hits or killing blows with a breath weapon this way that would apply for regaining a point of Inspiration do restore one point. While this effect is active, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter also continues to benefit from the See Invisibility effect from the Enhanced Scope Cannon Upgrade if the Sharpshooter possesses it.
<br>
##### Gunsmith
At 1st level, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter gains a musket as a starting firearm. His starting weapon is battered, and only he knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat his gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it’s worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.

In addition, at 1st level, as a standard action, the Sharpshooter can remove the broken condition from a single firearm he is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The Sharpshooter must have at least 1 Inspiration point to perform this action. Alternatively, if the Sharpshooter spends 1 Inspiration point to perform this action, he can perform the action as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action. The sharpshooter can attempt to repair a firearm this way even if his Inspiration pool is empty, but doing so puts a mental strain on the Sharpshooter and must make a Will saving throw with a DC of 10 + the maximum number of Draconic Inspiration the Sharpshooter has or become fatigued. If the Sharpshooter is already fatigued he cannot attempt to repair his weapon without having any Inspiration points.
<br>
##### Alchemical Essence (Su)
As the Dragonfire Sharpshooter begins to grow and become more comfortable with the innate draconic power they gain the ability to manifest that power into the ammunition they use. At 2nd level the Sharpshooter can pick one type of alchemical ammunition. When using that type of ammo the Sharpshooter reduces the amount added to their firearm’s misfire chance by 1 and when crafting that type of ammo using the Gunsmithing feat, they reduce the cost of crafting it by a percent equal to the number of ranks they have in the Craft (Alchemy) skill. In addition by spending 1 point of Inspiration as a move action, the Sharpshooter can fuse a piece of their chosen alchemical ammunition with a piece of their standard ammunition. Doing this allows the alchemical ammunition to do normal damage when striking an enemy and changes the DC (if applicable) to 10 + ½ the Sharpshooter’s level + the Sharpshooter’s Intelligence modifier. This flushed ammunition is unstable and is only viable for 24 hours until splitting back into its base pieces. The Sharpshooter selects an additional type of alchemical ammunition for this ability to apply to at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th).
<br>
##### Dragonfire Cannon
At 3rd level, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter has become familiar enough with their personal musket that they have devised a way to upgrade it and allow it to become enhanced by the draconic energies they wield. By spending three days in a location where the Sharpshooter can work without distraction, they upgrade their musket into a Dragonfire Cannon. The Dragonfire Cannon acts as a musket with the following exceptions; it deals damage as if it was one size category larger than it is (Dragonfire Cannons can never be smaller or larger than size of the Dragonfire Sharpshooter unless they have some ability to wield large weapons with no penalty, like the Half-Giant’s Powerful Build racial ability) and the range increment is increased by 20ft, to a base range increment of 60ft. Each Dragonfire Cannon is unique to its owner but it's a common choice to decorate the firearm with dragon scales or pelts if the Sharpshooter can get access to them. Some who have more reverence for their ancestors find this deplorable though. 
<br>
##### Cannon Upgrade
Starting at 4th level and every 4 levels afterwards, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter can begin to upgrade his Dragonfire Cannon. Each time he chooses an upgrade, the Sharpshooter must spend 8 hours in a location without distractions in order to add it to his firearm. Each of these upgrades, unless stated otherwise in their description, can be removed or reattached as a standard action.

##### Musket Training (Ex)
Starting at 6th level, the Dragonfire Sharpshooter increases her skill with two-handed firearms. He gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier, and when she misfires with a two-handed firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (10th, 14th, and 18th), the bonus on damage rolls increases by +1.
