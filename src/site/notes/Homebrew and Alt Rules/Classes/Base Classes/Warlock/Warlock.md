<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Classes\|Classes]] → Warlock</sup></sup>
Warlocks know there to be one truth above all others, power does not come without a cost. These avatars of eldritch energy do not gain their arcane abilities from dedicated study or from the blood of a powerful being introduced into their family generations ago. They do not worship traditional deities and few would consider their power a gift. The warlock derives its power from their patron, a powerful entity who has taken interest in the warlock. But, like all power, this did not come free. In order to gain this power the warlock either created a pact with this patron themselves or possibly had the pact forced upon them by another but whatever the cause, the warlock is now bonded to their patron for life, and possibly longer. Patrons can be almost any extradimensional being powerful enough to grant the power the warlock has gone seeking although the nature of the pact tends to attract less than benevolent entities such as devils who would find the idea of control over a mortal soul attractive. Because of this connotation with beings of the lower planes and the mysterious energy they wield, warlocks are rarely trusted or welcome and as such are sometimes forced to disguise themselves as sorcerers. The untrained eye may be fooled by such a ruse but any spellcaster worth their salt would recognize the smell of sulfur and brimstone after the warlock with an infernal pact unleashes the most carnal form of their power, the Eldritch Blast.

Role: Warlocks, while no true substitute for a [sorcerer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/) or [wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/) in certain regards, are an excellent supplement to them. While their spells lack those which cause damage, for that purpose the class possesses eldritch blast, and there are many battlefield control and utility spells on their list. They also gain more skills than more traditional arcane casters, and their proficiency with arms and armor (and higher hit points) serves them well in melee. The versatility of effects that a warlock can bring to a party ensures that this class will always find a place and an opportunity to shine.

### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Warlock.
<br>
##### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
The warlock is proficient with all simple weapons. He is proficient with light armor, but not with medium or heavy armor, or with shields of any type. The warlock can cast warlock spells (but not arcane spells gained from other classes) in light armor without incurring the normal chance of arcane spell failure. While wearing medium or heavy armor or when using a shield, a warlock suffers the normal chance of spell failure. 
<br>
##### Eldritch Blast (Su)
A warlock gains a supernatural ability known as the eldritch blast; this ability allow the warlock to focus his eldritch arcane energy into a damaging blast of dark energies able to wound, or even kill, his opponents. As a standard action a warlock can make a ranged touch attack against an opponent within 60 feet, dealing 1d6 points of damage (the damage results from pure arcane energy and does not possess an energy type, therefore energy resistances and immunities offer no protection). The target of the eldritch blast receives no saving throw. Although the eldritch blast itself does not provoke an attack of opportunity, it should be noted that all ranged touch attacks do provoke an attack of opportunity when the to-hit roll is made.

- As the Warlock increases in level, the damage dice of the eldritch blast increases as well, as shown on Table - Warlock above.
- An eldritch blast is not subject to spell resistance.
- An eldritch blast deals half damage to objects.
- An eldritch blast is not affected by spells such as *[globe of invulnerability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/globe-of-invulnerability/)*.

A warlock may apply the following feats to his eldritch blast, provided that he meets any applicable prerequisites for the feats chosen (a warlock is considered to be proficient with his own eldritch blast for the purpose of these feats): [Weapon Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/) (*eldritch blast*) and [Improved Critical](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-critical-combat/) (*eldritch blast*). A warlock may NOT select [Weapon Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/) (Ray) or [Improved Critical](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-critical-combat/) (Ray) and have it apply to his *eldritch blast*. 
<br>
##### Invocations (Su)
Warlocks learn a number of magic tricks, called invocations; these invocations are supernatural effects which (for the most part) can be used to alter his eldritch blast for more specialized purposes. One minor invocation (see below) instead grants the warlock the benefits (and detriments) of having a familiar.

- At 1st level, a warlock gains one of the following minor invocations of his choice. He gains an additional invocation at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level. A warlock cannot select an individual invocation more than once.
- Unless otherwise noted, invocations are part of the same standard action a warlock uses to unleash his eldritch blast. The save (if any) to resist an invocation is equal to 10 + ½ the warlock’s level + the warlock’s Charisma modifier.
- A warlock can apply only one invocation to any given eldritch blast.
<br>
##### Minor Invocations (Su)
*Beshadowed Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or become [blinded](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Blinded) for 2 rounds. On a successful save, the target is instead [dazzled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Dazzled) for 1 round. A warlock must be at least 6th level to select this invocation.

*Boreal Blast (Su)*: The warlock alters his eldritch blast to inflict cold damage. The damage on his eldritch blast increases by +1d6; this extra damage applies only to the boreal blast.

*Infuse Item (Su)*: The warlock uses his understanding of eldritch energies to infuse items with magic. A warlock gains an [item creation feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/) that he meets the requirements for. Like most invocations the warlock cannot select this more than once, however he can take this once more as a major invocation and one last time as a greater invocation at the appropriate levels if he chooses to do so.

*Eldritch Bond (Su)*: The warlock gains a [familiar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar/), using his warlock level as his effective wizard level. This familiar follows the rules for familiars presented in the [arcane bond](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-) wizard class feature. Additionally, when normal familiars gain the ability deliver touch spells, the warlock’s familiar instead gains the ability to deliver the warlock's eldritch blast. The familiar can apply one invocation that the warlock knows to the eldritch blast. If the familiar uses this ability to deliver eldritch blast, the warlock may NOT invoke eldritch blast (and any associated invocation) in the same round.

- A warlock who has selected eldritch bond as an invocation may select the feat [Improved Familiar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/improved-familiar/) if he so chooses.

*Eldritch Spear (Su)*: The warlock can use his eldritch blast at medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) instead of the standard 60-foot range.

*Exsanguinating Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer 1d6 points of bleed damage. On a successful save, the target instead suffers 1 point of bleed damage. Regardless, the DC for a heal check to staunch the bleeding is equal to that of the invocation; a cure wounds spell of any level automatically staunches this effect. A warlock must be at least 4th level to select this invocation.

*Frightful Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Will saving throw or become [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Shaken) for 2 rounds. On a successful save, the target is not affected. This is a mind-affecting, fear effect.

*Hideous Blow (Su)*: The warlock infuses his melee weapon with the power of his eldritch blast. This invocation may be used as a standard action, and imbues one melee weapon which the warlock is currently wielding with the energy of his eldritch blast. As part of the invocation, the warlock may make a single melee attack roll with his weapon, gaining a bonus on the attack roll equal to the warlock’s Charisma modifier (if any). If the attack successful hits the warlock deals normal weapon damage plus the full damage of his eldritch blast. A successful critical hit (using the weapon's critical threat range) multiplies the damage for both the weapon and the eldritch blast, with the damage for each figured separately and then added together if the critical multipliers are different. Since hideous blow is not a ranged touch attack, this is the only eldritch blast invocation that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A warlock must be at least 6th level to select this invocation.

*Hindering Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Will saving throw or become slowed (as per the spell *[slow](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow/)*) for 2 rounds. On a successful save, the target is not affected. Once a creature has been affected by this attack, they cannot be slowed again by a Hindering Blast for 24 hours.

*Inferno Blast (Su)*: The warlock alters his eldritch blast to inflict fire damage. The damage on his eldritch blast increases by +1d6; this extra damage applies only to the inferno blast.

*Maelstrom Blast (Su)*: The warlock alters his eldritch blast to inflict electricity damage. The damage on his eldritch blast increases by +1d6; this extra damage applies only to the maelstrom blast.

*Sickening Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or become [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Sickened) for 2 rounds. On a successful save, the target is not affected.

##### Spells
A warlock casts arcane spells drawn from the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock Spell List\|warlock spell list]]. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a warlock must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a warlock’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the warlock’s Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a warlock can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of the [Bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard/) class (below). In addition, he receives [bonus spells per day](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Abilities_and_Spellcasters) if he has a high Charisma score.

The warlock’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A warlock begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the warlock’s choice. At each new warlock level, he gains one or more new spells, as per the Bard spells known table (below). (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a warlock knows is not affected by his Charisma score.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third warlock level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a warlock can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the warlock “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level warlock spell the warlock can cast. A warlock may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

A warlock need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.
<br>
##### Cantrips (Su)
Warlocks learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted under Spells Known (see above). These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.
<br>
##### Eldritch Body (Ex)
At 3rd level, the warlock’s exposure to eldritch arcane energies begins to strengthen his body, providing protection from many attacks. He gains DR 2/cold iron or DR 2/silver (his choice; once this decision has been made it cannot be changed). This increases by 1 at 5th level and every two levels gained thereafter, to a maximum of DR 10/cold iron or DR 10/silver at 19th level. 
<br>
##### Deceive Item (Ex)
At 4th level and higher, a warlock has the ability to more easily commandeer magic items made for the use of other characters. When making a Use Magic Device check, a warlock can take 10 even if distracted or threatened. 
<br>
##### Energy Resistance (Ex)
At 5th level, the warlock gains resistance 5 to two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, and fire. The warlock chooses which types of energy he becomes resistant to. At 11th level, both of these resistances increase to 10. At 17th level, the warlock’s energy resistances once again increase, this time to 20. Unlike most forms of Energy Resistance, which do not stack, these bonuses stack only with any Racial Energy Resistance the Warlock may have. 
<br>
##### Eldritch Hands (Sp)
Starting at 6th level, a warlock can use *[Telekinesis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telekinesis/)*, as per the spell except as stated below, as a standard action once each round. The warlock is limited to a maximum weight of 10 lbs per warlock level (to a maximum caster level of 15, as per the spell), and he may only manipulate a single object with the violent thrust aspect, regardless of his caster level. In addition, the warlock may only use this ability at medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) instead of the long range listed for the spell. 
<br>
##### Eldritch Resilience (Su)
At 7th level, once per day the warlock can use his eldritch energy to reknit his tissues, sinews, and bones. The warlock can use a swift action to grant himself [fast healing](https://roll20.net/compendium/pathfinder/Fast%20Healing#content) 1 for 20 rounds. At 10th level, and every three levels gained thereafter, the fast healing granted by eldritch resilience increases by 1 to a maximum of [fast healing](https://roll20.net/compendium/pathfinder/Fast%20Healing#content) 5 at 18th level. The warlock can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level. 
<br>
##### Eldritch Aura (Su)
At 8th level, a warlock’s eldritch power grows strong enough that he unconsciously releases damaging attacks on those who harm him. Any melee attack that damages the warlock for at least 1 point of lethal damage causes a backlash in eldritch energy. This backlash deals 1d8 points of damage to the attacker. This damage results from pure arcane energy and does not possess an energy type, therefore energy resistances, energy immunities, and damage reduction of any type offer no protection against it. It always deals lethal damage and is not under the conscious control of the warlock. Any melee attack that inflicts lethal damage to the warlock provokes the use of this ability. At 12th level, and every four levels gained thereafter as a warlock, the damage inflicted by the warlock’s eldritch aura increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 4d8 at 20th level. 
<br>
##### Eldritch Knowledge (Su)
At 9th level, the warlock gains a 1st-level arcane spell of his choice that he may add to his list of spells known. He may select from any 1st-level [Bard](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/tools/spell-list-filters/bard-spell-list-filter/), [Magus](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/tools/spell-list-filters/magus-spell-list-filter/), [Sorcerer/Wizard](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/tools/spell-list-filters/sorcerer-wizard-spell-list-filter/), or [Witch](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/tools/spell-list-filters/witch-spell-list-filter/) spell to add to his spells known as a warlock spell of the appropriate level. At 11th level, and every two levels gained thereafter, the warlock gains knowledge of another arcane spell, each time of a progressively higher level (2nd-level spell at 11th level, 3rd-level spell at 13th-level, etc). 
<br>
##### Major Invocations (Su)
Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a warlock can choose one of the following major invocations whenever he could select a new invocation.

*Bewitching Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or become [confused](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Confused) for 2 rounds. On a successful save, the target is not affected.

*Eldritch Bolt (Su)*: The warlock invokes his eldritch blast in a 120-foot line that is 5-feet wide and affects all creatures within the area. No attack roll is needed for this invocation, but all targets in the area of effect are allowed a Reflex save for one-half damage.

*Eldritch Cone (Su)*: The warlock invokes his eldritch blast in a 60-foot cone that affects all creatures within the area. No attack roll is needed for this invocation, but all targets in the area of effect are allowed a Reflex save for one-half damage.

*Entropic Blast (Su)*: This invocation can only be used against objects weighing no more than 10 pounds per warlock level. The object takes full damage (not half) from the eldritch blast, and has its [hardness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects/) reduced by one-half. This is an instantaneous effect. Any single object can only have its hardness reduced once by this invocation. Magical or attended objects are allowed a Will save to negate the [hardness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects/) reduction and reduce the damage to one-half the amount rolled; non-magical unattended objects do not receive a saving throw and suffer the listed effects of this invocation.

*Fatiguing Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or become [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Fatigued). On a successful save, the target is not affected. This invocation does not stack with itself. If a creature fails its save against this invocation twice, he remains [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Fatigued) and does not become [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Exhausted).

*Flurry Blast (Su)*: The warlock may select up to three targets for his eldritch blast, so long as each target is within sixty feet of the warlock and no two targets are separated by more than fifteen feet from one another. Each target requires a different ranged touch attack and, if the attack is successful, suffers 3d8 damage (NOT the normal damage the warlock deals with his eldritch blast). If the warlock threatens (and then confirms) a critical hit, that target suffers 6d8 damage from the flurry blast. At 16th level, and again at 20th level, a warlock with this invocation can strike one additional eligible target (four at 16th level, and five at 20th level) with a 3d8 bolt from the flurry blast.

*Noxious Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or become [nauseated](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Nauseated) for 2 rounds. On a successful save, the target is [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Sickened) for 1 round.

*Repelling Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Will saving throw or be moved 5 feet in a direction directly away from the warlock for every 5 points of damage he suffers. If the target strikes an immobile, solid object (such as wall) while still having movement remaining, he suffers an additional 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet of movement remaining. While moving in such a fashion, the target provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful save negates the repelling effect.

*Thundering Blast (Su)*: The warlock alters his eldritch blast to inflict sonic damage. Unlike other invocations that alter the energy of his eldritch blast no additional damage dice are gained.

*Vitriolic Blast (Su)*: The warlock alters his eldritch blast to inflict acid damage. The damage on his eldritch blast increases by +2d6; this extra damage applies only to the vitriolic blast.

*Weakening Bolt (Su)*: Any creature damaged by the warlock’s eldritch bolt must make a Will save or take 2 points of Strength damage. On a successful save, the target only takes 1 point of Strength damage. 
<br>
##### Empower Invocation (Su)
At 11th level, a warlock may empower (as per the feat [Empower Spell](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/empower-spell-metamagic-final/)) his eldritch blast or any invocation that he knows. He may use this ability once per day. At 13th level, and every two warlock levels gained thereafter, a warlock gains one daily use of this ability, to a maximum of five times per day at 19th level. 
<br>
##### Greater Invocations (Su)
Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a warlock can choose of one of the following greater invocations whenever he could select a new invocation.

*Banishing Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage. If the target is an outsider or a creature otherwise summoned or called through a spell-effect (such as a creature summoned by any [summon monster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster/) or [summon nature’s ally](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally/) spell) it must make a Will saving throw or suffer the effects of [dismissal](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dismissal/) (as per the spell) if the target is an outsider. If the target has merely been summoned via a spell but is not an outsider, this invocation ends that spell for the targeted creature if the creature fails to make his Will saving throw, immediately sending it back to where it was summoned from.

*Eldritch Doom (Su)*: The warlock invokes his eldritch blast in a 20-foot radius spread with a range of 60-feet that affects all creatures within the area. No attack roll is needed for this invocation, but all targets in the area of effect are allowed a Reflex save for one-half damage.

*Exhausting Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or become [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Exhausted). On a successful save, the target is [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Fatigued) instead. This invocation does not stack with itself. If a creature successfully saves against this invocation twice, he remains [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Fatigued) and does not become [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Exhausted).

*Horrific Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Will saving throw or be [stunned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Stunned) for 2 rounds. On a successful save, the target is [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Staggered) for 1 round.

*Mirror Blast (Su)*: The warlock can select two targets within range of his eldritch blast, so long as both targets are within 30 feet of each other. He makes a ranged touch attack against both targets, and (if both attack rolls are successful) he rolls the damage against both targets. Each target suffers the result of the higher damage roll and the lower damage roll is disregarded. If only one target is struck, only one damage roll is made against that target. if either of the attack rolls results in a confirmed critical hit, both targets (if both are struck) suffer a critical hit.

*Utterdark Blast (Su)*: The target of the eldritch blast suffers normal damage and must make a Fortitude saving throw or gain 2 [negative levels](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities/#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels). On a successful save, the target does not gain any negative levels. Undead creatures suffer no damage and gain no benefit from this invocation. 
<br>
##### Warlock Supreme (Su)
At 20th level, the warlock undergoes an eldritch apotheosis that is the culmination of all that he has strived to achieve. His two energy resistances improve to immunities and he gains resistance 10 against the two energy types he did not select. Five times per day, but no more than once per round, he may use his eldritch blast, and any applied invocations, as a swift action instead of a standard action. His damage reduction increases to DR 10/cold iron and magic or DR 10/silver and magic, depending on which material the character selected at 3rd level. The warlock can also select one 7th-level [sorcerer/wizard](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/tools/spell-list-filters/sorcerer-wizard-spell-list-filter/) or [witch](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/tools/spell-list-filters/witch-spell-list-filter/) spell of his choice and add it to his spells known as a 6th-level warlock spell.
<br>
##### Clarifications
**Warlocks and Metamagic-type Feats**: Warlocks are not eligible for feats such as [Empower Spell-Like Ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/empower-spell-like-ability/) or [Quicken Spell-Like Ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/quicken-spell-like-ability/). The eldritch blast and various invocations are classified as supernatural abilities, and there is sufficient difference between the two that the warlock is unable to use these monster feats. In much the same fashion, a warlock cannot apply a [metamagic feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/) to his eldritch blast or to his various invocations (although he can apply such feats to his spells as normal).

**Warlocks and Ability Focus**: Warlocks may take the feat [Ability Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/ability-focus/), applied to a single invocation of his choice. A warlock can select this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different invocation. The feat must be taken for a specific invocation that requires a saving throw and does not apply to any other invocation that the warlock knows or invokes.
