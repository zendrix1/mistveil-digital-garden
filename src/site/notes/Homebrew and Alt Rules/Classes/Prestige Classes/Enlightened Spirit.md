<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Classes\|Classes]] → Enlightened Spirit</sup></sup>
Although the fiendish origins of many warlocks' powers can't be denied, they need not fully embrace the darkness. Some warlocks start down the fiendish path, then repent and turn toward the light, others are granted their power from more benevolent beings from the beginning. Such rare individuals are called Enlightened Spirits.

### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Enlightened Spirit.
<br>
##### Spells per Day
At the indicated levels, an Enlightened Spirit gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, normally gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an Enlightened Spirit, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. 
<br>
##### Aura of Courage (Su)
At 1st level, you are immune to fear and each ally within 10 feet of you gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. 
<br>
##### Aura of Menace (Su)
At 1st level, a righteous aura surrounds you whenever you are in the presence of hostility. Any hostile creature within a 5-foot radius of you takes a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until it successfully hits you. A creature that has the effect (normally by successfully hitting you) cannot be affected again by your Aura of Menace for 24 hours.
<br>
##### Eldritch Advancement
Your Enlightened Spirit levels stack with levels in the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] base class for the purpose of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Eldritch Blast (Su)\|Eldritch Blast]] and any other ability whose effects are determined based on total your [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] level.
<br>
##### New Spells
Add the following spells to the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock Spell List\|Warlock Spell List]] using the [Cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) spell level:
- [Protection from Evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/protection-from-evil/)
- [Cure Light Wounds](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cure-light-wounds)
- [Cure Moderate Wounds](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cure-moderate-wounds)
- [Breath of Life](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/breath-of-life)
- [Magic Circle against Evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-circle-against-evil/)
- [Dispel Evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-evil)
<br>
##### Spirit Blast (Su)
At 1st level you gain the *Spirit Blast* invocation. 

*Spirit Blast*: The Enlightened Spirit alters his [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Eldritch Blast (Su)\|Eldritch Blast]] into a Spirit Blast, dealing an extra 1 point of damage per die to undead. Your Spirit Blast also affects incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance. 
<br>
##### Spirit Armor (Su)
Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a +1 sacred bonus to your Armor Class. The bonus improves to +2 at 6th level and +3 at 10th level. 
<br>
##### Celestial Flight (Su)
At 3rd level, you gain the *Celestial Flight* invocation. 

*Celestial Flight*: The powers of light bear you aloft as you sprout shimmering spirit wings. You can fly at a speed equal to your land speed with [good maneuverability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly/) (granting a +4 bonus to your Fly skill).
<br>
##### Tongues (Su)
At 4th level, you can speak any language. This ability works as the *[Tongues](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tongues/)* spell, except that it is continuously active. You can suppress or resume the effect as a free action.
<br>
##### Invocation
At 5th level you may choice one [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Minor Invocations (Su)\|Minor]] or [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Major Invocations (Su)\|Major Invocation]] from the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]] class. 
<br>
##### Energy Resistance (Su)
At 5th level, you gain resistance 5 to any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, and fire. If you already have energy resistance from the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Energy Resistance (Ex)\|Energy Resistance]] class feature of the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]], the two sources stack (unlike normal energy resistance, which does not stack from multiple sources).
<br>
##### Holy Blast (Su)
At 7th level, you gain the *Holy Blast* invocation.

*Holy Blast*: The Enlightened Spirit alters his [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Base Classes/Warlock/Warlock#Eldritch Blast (Su)\|Eldritch Blast]] into a Holy Blast dealing an extra 1 point of damage per die to evil outsiders. The blast also affects any evil outsider as if you had cast a [*Dimensional Anchor*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimensional-anchor/) spell on it.
<br>
##### Transform Magic (Su)
At 9th level, you gain the *Transform Magic* invocation.

*Transform Magic*: You deliver a targeted [*Greater Dispel Magic*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic/) with your touch then you or any ally within 30 feet of you heals 5 hit points for each spell level dispelled by this touch (the spell level is determined by its caster's class). For example, if you successfully dispel a [*Wall of Ice*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-ice/) cast by a [Wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard), you or an ally near you can heal up to 20 hit points but a [*Wall of Ice*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-ice/) cast by a [Summoner](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner) would only heal 15. You can't dispel your own invocations this way.
<br>
##### Death Ward (Su)
At 10th level, you become immune to death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and negative energy effects as the [*Death Ward*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/death-ward/) spell. In addition you no longer receive negative effects by aging and cannot die from old age.
<br>
### Ex-Enlightened Spirits
An enlightened spirit who becomes non-good loses all class features granted by this prestige class and can't gain any further levels of enlightened spirit. You can regain your abilities and advancement potential if you once again become good and atone for your violations in whatever method your patron demands.
