<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Classes\|Classes]] → Arcane Manipulator</sup></sup>
The Arcanist is a savant of understanding traditional arcane methods and secrets but there are some who wish to go even further and study the effects of arcane magic though nontraditional ways. These studies include the recreation of divine magic and the manipulation of the magic that flows through their own bodies to bolster their constitution and restore their reserves of magic. The students of these studies are known as Arcane Manipulators.

### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Arcane Manipulator.
<br>
##### Spells per Day/Spells Known
When a new Arcane Manipulator level is gained, the character gains new spells as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting with one exception. Arcane Manipulator levels count as Arcanist levels for the purpose of determining saving throw DC for an Arcanist Exploit. If the character has more than one spellcasting class before becoming an Arcane Manipulator she must decide which class she adds the new level to for the purpose of determining spells per day. 
<br>
##### Spell Imitation (Su)
At each class level, the Arcane Manipulator chooses a spell from the [Cleric spell list](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-cleric/) that is in school that she has Spell Focus in and treats it as if it were on the Arcanist spell list. An Arcane Manipulator must choose a Cleric spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can currently cast. The spell’s type becomes arcane, its save DC functions as normal for the arcane spellcasting class list she adds it to, and it is considered an Arcanist spell for the purpose of the [Spell Specialization](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-specialization/) feat. The Arcane Manipulator automatically learns this spell, adding it to her spellbook. 
<br>
##### Spell Specialization
Arcane Manipulator levels count as Arcanist levels for the purpose of switching which spell the feat applies to upon gaining even levels. At 4th level she gains [Spell Specialization](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-specialization/) as a bonus feat for a new spell.
<br>
##### Magical Fortitude (Su)
At 1st level, the Arcane Manipulator can tap into the magic that flows through her and bolster her health. Starting with the hit points she rolls for gaining her first Arcane Manipulator level and every time she gains a level in any class thereafter, the character may choose to add either her Constitution bonus or her Charisma bonus to the number of new hit points she gains for that level. 
<br>
##### Bonus Exploit
At 2nd level, the Arcane Manipulator furthers their ability to shape magic. They gain an Arcanist Exploit from the following list. At 5th level the Arcane Manipulator gains another Exploit from the following list.

[Counterspell](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/counterspell), [Metamagic Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/metamagic-knowledge), [Potent Magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/potent-magic-su), [School Understanding](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/school-understanding), [See Magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/see-magic-su), [Spell Disruption](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/spell-disruption-su), [Spell Tinkerer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits/spell-tinkerer-su).
<br>
##### Spell Focus
At 3rd level, the Arcane Manipulator gains their choice of either [Spell Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-focus) or [Greater Spell Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/greater-spell-focus/) as a bonus feat, they must still meet the prerequisites.
<br>
##### Universal Specialization (Su)
At 4th level, the Arcane Manipulator can delve into their nearly bottomless well of arcane knowledge to reach an increased understanding of a specific spell. An Arcane Manipulator can switch which spells their Spell Specialization feats apply to by expending 2 points from her arcane reservoir and meditating for 1 minute. This counts as a special Arcanist Exploit that only an Arcane Manipulator can learn. 
<br>
##### Twilight Body (Ex)
At 5th level, the Arcane Manipulator has gained the ability to alter the flow of magic through their body and prevent the negative effects of aging. This functions exactly like the Druid ability, [Timeless Body](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/Druid/#Timeless_Body_Ex).
