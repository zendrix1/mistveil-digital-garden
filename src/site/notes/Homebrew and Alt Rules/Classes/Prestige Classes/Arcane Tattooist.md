### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Arcane Manipulator.
<br>
##### Spells per Day
At the indicated levels, an Arcane Tattooist gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, normally gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. There are some exceptions however, explained in the Persistent Bloodline class feature below. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an Arcane Tattooist, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. 
<br>
##### Improved Tattoo Familiar (Su) 
At 1st level, the Arcane Tattooist’s Tattoo Familiar expands and lengthens, resembling a golden dragon. The Arcane Tattooist’s familiar becomes a [Calligraphy Wyrm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/wyrm-calligraphy/) as if its master had the [Improved Familiar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/improved-familiar/) feat except they either determine their own hit points or use half of their master’s HP (whichever is higher). In addition, the transformed familiar retains special ability and its feats from its base form as well as its personality and memories. Lastly, if your familiar falls in combat, they immediately return to their tattoo form. They can’t take physical form and the master cannot benefit from any abilities involving the familiar until he can restore his familiar which takes 8 hours of work.
<br>
##### Persistent Bloodline (Su) 
For the purpose of determining bonus spells and ability uses per day of the Arcane Tattooist’s bloodline, its levels stack with that of [Sorcerer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/). Note, this does not grant new abilities or bonus feats from the bloodline as the Arcane Tattooist gains levels.
<br>
##### Enhance Tattoo Familiar (Su)
At 2nd level, the Arcane Tattooist is able to start making changes to their Tattoo Familiar while it is in its tattoo form that manifest in different abilities for the familiar. Starting at 6 HD and every 3 HD gain afterwards, the familiar increase in one size category (to a maximum size of Medium at 12 HD), the range of the familiar’s ink spray increases by 5ft, and their movement speeds increase by 10ft with each size increase. In addition, for every 2 HD the familiar has, they gain one ability from the list below. Each time the Arcane Tattooist adds a new ability to their Tattoo Familiar, they can also alter their tattoo to swap one previous ability with another.

|    **Ability**   |                                    **Description**                                   |
|:----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     Climber<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>     |            Gains climb 20 ft. or existing climb speed improves by 20 ft.             |
|    Dexterous     |                                 Gains +2 Dexterity.                                  |
|     Durable<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>     |                                     Gains 10 hp.                                     |
|      Flyer<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>      | Existing fly speed improves by 20 ft. and maneuverability improves by one category.  |
|      Sharp       |   Familiar uses dexterity bonus for damage on natural attacks instead of strength.   |
|     Skilled<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>     |                   Gains +3 competence bonus on chosen skill check.                   |
|  Sneak Attack<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>   |                 Improves sneak attack +1d6 (as rogue class feature).                 |
|      Strong      |                                  Gains +2 Strength.                                  |
|     Swimmer<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>     |             Gains swim 20 ft. or existing swim speed improves by 20 ft.              |
|    Telepathy     |  Telepathy between homunculus and creator increases to 1 mile/level of the creator.  |
| Weapon Ability<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>  |                        Natural weapons gain special ability.                         |
<sup><sup>1</sup> May be chosen more than once. Multiple selections stack. <sup>2</sup> May be chosen more than once. Multiple selections do not stack; instead, each selection of the ability applies to a new skill or weapon ability.</sup>

*Weapon Ability*: When this ability is granted, choose a [weapon special ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/) with a base price modifier of "+1 bonus," such as ghost touch, keen, or shock. The homunculus's natural weapons are treated as if they had this special ability. 
<br>
##### Create Spell Tattoo (Su)
At 3rd level, the Arcane Tattooist gains the *[Create Spell Tattoo](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/SORCERER/archetypes/paizo-sorcerer-archetypes/tattooed-sorcerer/#Create_Spell_Tattoo_Su)* feature of the Tattooed Sorcerer class archetype. If the Arcane Tattooist already has this class feature he gains one additional use of this ability per day. The Arcane Tattooist counts his levels as Sorcerer levels for the purpose of determining uses per day.
<br>
##### Etched Bond (Su)
At 3rd level, the Arcane Tattooist’s bond with his Tattoo Familiar has become deeper than that of normal masters and familiars. The Arcane Tattooist now benefits from the [Alertness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/alertness/) feat when even his familiar is in its tattoo form, and can speak and understand any language the familiar knows while its in tattoo form (including _[Read Magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/read-magic/)_ if the familiar has it active at the time). While the familiar is in its tattoo form, the Arcane Tattooist gains all the same senses that the familiar has (if he did not already have them) at half the range the familiar can use them. In addition, the familiar can now bring any equipment it is wearing or holding into its tattoo form along with it. The familiar cannot do this if it’s over its maximum load however. Lastly, the Arcane Tattooist can now bestow a special [Spell Tattoo](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-spell) on his familiar. This [Spell Tattoo](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-spell) has to have a range of touch, can’t have material components or a focus, and must be at least 2 levels below the highest spell level the Arcane Tattooist can cast. The tattoo appears as different colored scales on the Tattoo Familiar and dulls after being used until it recharges. The familiar can unleash the spell as a melee touch attack before needing to let the ability recharge in the same way that the familiar’s Ink Spray recharges (2d4 cooldown). The Arcane Tattooist can change which spell is infused with his familiar during a long rest as long as the familiar is with him during the entire rest.
<br>
##### Improved Mage’s Tattoo (Sp)
At 4th level, the Arcane Tattooist has become experienced enough in the creation and altering magical tattoos to make his [Mage’s Tattoo](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/mages-tattoo/) much more effective. Based on school you choose when you take the feat, you can an additional spell-like ability that can be used once per day. In addition, you can use the spell-like ability granted originally at-will instead of three times per day.

- Abjuration: [*Stoneskin*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stoneskin/)
- Conjuration: [*Acid Pit*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/acid-pit/)
- Enchantment: [*Mass Daze*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daze/)
- Evocation: [*Unbearable Brightness*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/u/unbearable-brightness/)
- Illusion: [*Complex Hallucination*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/complex-hallucination/)
- Necromancy: [*Bestow Curse*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bestow-curse/)
- Transmutation: [*Telekinetic Maneuver*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telekinetic-maneuver/)
<br>
##### Skillful Tattooist (Ex)
At 5th level, as long as an Arcane Tattooist is using his [Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft/) skill to craft magical tattoos on his own body, he can do so in half the time it would normally take.
<br>
##### Improved Etched Bond (Su)
At 6th level, the magical ties between the Arcane Tattooist and his Tattoo Familiar grow stronger yet. As long as the familiar is in its tattoo form, the Arcane Tattooist gains the [*Evasion*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Rogue/#TOC-Evasion-Ex-) class feature (as Rogue) and a spell resistance equal to half of his familiars SR. The special Spell Tattoo can now be up to 1 level lower than the highest level spell the Arcane Tattooist can cast and has a reduced cooldown of 1d4 rounds. 
<br>
##### Tattoo Mastery (Ex)
At 7th level, an Arcane Tattooist can use his own ability score modifier and relevant feats to set the DC for spell tattoos he crafts, and can use his own caster level if it is higher than that of the spell tattoo he is crafting (similar to a caster using a staff.) 
<br>
##### Improved Ink Spray (Su)
At 8th level, the Arcane Tattooist’s familiar has grown enough to improve their Ink Spray breath weapon. Now instead of just black ink, they are able to spray glowing multicolored ink that acts in every way like the _[Glitterdust](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/glitterdust/)_ spell. The reflex save to avoid this attack is DC 12 + the familiar or master’s Cha modifier (whichever is higher). The range of this attack increases by 5ft, and the recharge is lowered to 1d4. The familiar can still choose to spray normal black ink with this attack, but if it does the target receives no penalty to their stealth modifier.
<br>
##### Perfect Tattoo Familiar (Su)
At 10th level, the Arcane Tattooist has mastered altering his Tattoo Familiar and is able to draw out its true form, that of a [Sovereign Dragon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/imperial-sovereign/sovereign-dragon-juvenile/). The Arcane Tattooist’s familiar becomes large, gains _Dragon Senses_ in addition to any senses they already have (multiple source of senses, such as darkvision, do not stack. They simply change to whichever distance is farther), they gain the _Frightful Presence_ of a Juvenile Sovereign Dragon, their Natural Armor adjustment changes to +16 (for levels 15th-16th, then changes accordingly for higher levels), they gain a 40ft breath weapon that does d6/HD sonic damage (the Arcane Tattooist is immune to this breath weapon), they gain _[Calm Emotions](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/calm-emotions/)_ and _[Detect Good/Evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil/)_ as at-will spell-like abilities with a CL equal to their HD, their base ability scores become the same as a Juvenile Sovereign Dragon, they gain the following skills as class skills; [Appraise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/appraise), [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate), [Knowledge (history and nobility)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge), and [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive) and gain the same ranks in those skills as a Juvenile Sovereign Dragon, they gain the following as bonus feats; [Improved Critical (bite)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-critical-combat/), [Improved Initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-initiative-combat/), [Iron Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/iron-will/), [Lightning Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/lightning-reflexes/), [Multiattack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/multiattack-combat/), [Persuasive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/persuasive/), and [Weapon Focus (bite)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat/), it learns the Auran language, gains the Dogmatic Discordance (Su) ability of a Juvenile Sovereign Dragon making good or evil aligned creatures take a -2 penalty when making saving throws against its spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura, and finally gains the Violent Retort (Ex) ability of a Juvenile Sovereign Dragon allowing it to make a claw or tail slap attack as an immediate action when it takes damage from a melee attack critical hit against the creature that made the critical hit.

When the Arcane Tattooist gains this class feature, their Tattoo Familiar stretches and wraps across their body, in this moment of transformation he can swap any previous abilities given by the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Prestige Classes/Arcane Tattooist#Enhance Tattoo Familiar (Su)\|Enhance Tattoo Familiar]] for different ones.

In addition to this transformation, the Tattoo Familiar is able to bestow even more of its abilities to the Arcane Tattooist while in its tattoo form. While in tattoo form, the Tattoo Familiar is able to grant its master all of its senses in full, its immunity to paralysis and sleep, its movement types and speed, 3/day as a standard action the Arcane Tattooist can use the Tattoo Familiar’s breath weapon, and 1/day the Arcane Tattooist can manifest the Tattoo Familiar’s _Frightful Presence_ on enemies.
