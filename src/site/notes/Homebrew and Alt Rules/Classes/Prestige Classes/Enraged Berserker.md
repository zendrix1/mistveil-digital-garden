<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Classes/Classes\|Classes]] → Enraged Berserker</sup></sup>
It is common knowledge that certain warriors choose to let rage guide them in combat but for some that rage becomes so all encompassing that everything else in the world dims around them while they fight. Those who embrace this dangerous power are known as Enraged Berserkers and are a threat to anyone and everyone in their path, be them foe or sometimes, friend.

### Class Features
The following are the class features of the Enraged Berserker.
<br>
##### Berserker Rage (Ex)
An Enraged Berserker can enter a more intense form of rage known as a Berserker Rage. While Berserk, she gains a +3 bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. In addition if she makes a full attack action, she gains a single extra attack each round at her highest bonus. (This latter effect is not cumulative with haste or other effects that grant additional attacks.) However, she also takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and takes 2 points of nonlethal damage per round while Berserk. These bonuses and penalties stack with any granted by the [rage class feature](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/Barbarian-unchained/#TOC-Rage-Ex-). A Berserker Rage lasts for as many rounds of rage that the Enraged Berserker has remaining. To end the Berserker Rage before its duration expires, the character may attempt a DC 20 Will save once per round as a free action. Success ends the Berserker Rage immediately; failure means it continues. The effects of Berserker Rage stack with those from any rage ability the character may have.

While under the effects of a Berserker Rage, the Enraged Berserker is immune to fear (magical or otherwise).

At 1st level, the character can enter a Berserker Rage once per day. Thereafter, she gains one additional use per day of this ability for every two Enraged Berserker levels she acquires (but she can't use the ability more than once in any encounter). The Enraged Berserker can enter a Berserker Rage as a free action while raging. In addition, if she takes damage from an attack, spell, trap, or any other source, she automatically enters a Berserker Rage at the beginning of her next turn as long as she still has at least one daily usage of the ability left and at least one round of rage left. To avoid entering a Berserker Rage in response to a provoking effect, the Enraged Berserker must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + points of damage taken since the first provoking effect) at the start of her next turn.

While Berserk, the character cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence- based skills (except for Intimidate and Acrobatics) or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can she cast spells, drink potions, activate magic items, or read scrolls. She can use any feat she has except for those that require concentration such as Combat Expertise, item creation feats, or metamagic feats.

During a Berserker Rage, the Enraged Berserker must attack those she perceives as foes to the best of her ability. Should she run out of enemies before her Berserker Rage expires, her rampage continues. She must then attack the nearest creature (determine randomly if several potential creatures are equidistant) and fight that opponent without regard to friendship, innocence, or health (the target's or her own).

When a Berserker Rage ends, the Enraged Berserker is [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Conditions/#Exhausted) instead of [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Conditions/#Fatigued) like normal when ending a rage but still only for 1 minute.
<br>
##### Diehard
At 2nd level an Enraged Berserker gains [Diehard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/diehard/) as a bonus feat even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If she already has Diehard or gains it from another source, instead she gains [Survivor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/survivor/) as a bonus feat even if she does not meet the prerequisites.
<br>
##### Rage Power
Starting at 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, an Enraged Berserker gains a [Rage Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/Barbarian-unchained/#TOC-Rage-Powers). The character's levels in Enraged Berserker stack with their [Barbarian](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/Barbarian-unchained/) levels for the purposes of which [Rage Powers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/Barbarian-unchained/#TOC-Rage-Powers) they can choose and the Power's effectiveness.
<br>
##### Supreme Cleave
At 3rd level, an Enraged Berserker can take a 5-foot step between attacks when using the [Cleave](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/cleave-combat/) or [Great Cleave](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/great-cleave-combat/) feats. She is still limited to one such adjustment per round, so she cannot use this ability during a round in which she has already taken a 5-foot step however she is allowed to perform this 5-foot step *even* if she has already made other movement this round, unlike normal.
<br>
##### Reckless Rage
At 4th level, an Enraged Berserker gains [Reckless Rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/reckless-rage/) as a bonus feat even if she does not meet the prerequisites. Note: The [Furious Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/furious-focus-combat) feat and Improved Furious Focus class feature do not remove [Reckless Rage's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/reckless-rage/) penalty to Power Attacks.
<br>
##### Too Angry to Die
At 5th level, an Enraged Berserker can scorn death and unconsciousness while Berserk. As long as her Berserker Rage continues, she is not treated as disabled at 0 hit points, nor is she treated as dying while in negative hit points. Even if reduced to negative hit points equal to her Constitution score or less, she continues to fight normally until her Berserker Rage ends. At that point, the effects of her wounds apply normally if they have not been healed. This ability does not prevent death from spell or ability effects such as [*Phantasmal Killer*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/phantasmal-killer/) or a [Death Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/assassin/#Death_Attack_Ex).
<br>
##### Improved Furious Focus
At 7th level, an Enraged Berserker no longer suffers penalties while Power Attacking on their turn while they are raging with a two-handed weapon or one-handed weapon in two hands. She still suffers the penalty on attacks of opportunity. 
<br>
##### Tireless Rage
At 10th level, an Enraged Berserker is no longer fatigued at the end of her rage however if she enters a rage again within 1 minute of ending a rage, she doesn’t gain any temporary hit points from her rage. In addition she is no longer exhausted at the end of a Berserker Rage but is instead fatigued for 1 minute.
