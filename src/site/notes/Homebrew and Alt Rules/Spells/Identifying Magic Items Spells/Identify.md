This spell can be used as a free action alongside a casting of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Spells/Modified Spells/Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]] and grants a +10 enhancement bonus on [Spellcraft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft) checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession.

Alternatively, this spell can be cast on its own with a casting time of 1 hour and requiring an additional Material Component of a crushed pearl worth at least 100gp mixed into the wine. Casting *Identify* this way automatically determines all magic properties of one magic item per two caster levels (minimum 1), including how to activate those functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if any).

Identify sometimes does not function when used on an artifact or may only partially reveal properties and could have unexpected results.

**Arcane Material Component** 
A vial of wine stirred with an owl feather.

*A pearl of at least 100 gp value, crushed and stirred into wine with an owl feather; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting.
