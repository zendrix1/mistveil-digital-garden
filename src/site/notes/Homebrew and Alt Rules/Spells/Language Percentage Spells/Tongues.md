This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. _Tongues_ does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don’t speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way. Your [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Not in Use/Language Percentages\|comprehension]] of all languages you do not already know becomes 85% and any you already know that are below 85% raised to 85% but only for the purpose of speaking, not for reading or writing it.

_Tongues_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.
