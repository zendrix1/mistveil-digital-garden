<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Half-Ashlung Orcs</sup></sup>
These hybrids between [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Ashlung Orcs\|Ashlung Orcs]] and [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]] or [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elves]] are extremely rare but are seen by some [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Ashlung Orcs\|Ashlungs]] as a great hope for their race. Even though Half-Ashlung Orcs are born with the same darkened skin the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Ashlung Orcs\|Ashlungs]] were cursed with, they aren't reliant upon ash the same way (nor do they breathe out ash the same way). Because of this, many within the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Ashlung Orcs\|Ashlung Orcs]] see these half-breeds as an opportunity to bring their race back to their former glory. This opinion isn’t shared by all the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Ashlung Orcs\|Ashlungs]] though, with some seeing Half-Ashlung Orcs as the sign that they are blending into the other cultures instead of ruling over them, which is fundamentally against their concept of "freedom".
