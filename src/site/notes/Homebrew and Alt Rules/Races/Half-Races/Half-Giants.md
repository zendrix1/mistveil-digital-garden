<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Half-Giants</sup></sup>
The bastard children of [[Hill Giants\|Hill Giants]] and [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]], Half-Giants are bulking humanoids that are rarely accepted in any society. Most Half-Giants are built very similarly to their larger parents, standing about a foot taller than the average [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]], but unfortunately many also inherited their ability to think logically from their Giant parents. Although sometimes mistaken for slightly smaller [[Hill Giants\|Hill Giants]], if you were to look closely you would see that their facial features are more defined that the standard [[Hill Giants\|Hill Giant]] and most Half-Giants, although not all, are less outwardly violent as well.

### Half-Giant Racial Traits
- Ability Score Racial Traits: Half-Giants are very large and bulky but learning new things comes very slowly for them. They receive +4 Str, +2 Con, -4 Int, and -2 Wisdom.
- Size: Half-Giants are Medium creatures.
- Type: Half-Giant are Humanoids with the [Giant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#TOC-Giant-Subtype) subtype
- Base Speed: Half-Giants have a base speed of 30 feet.
- Languages: Half-Giant's native language is Giant.
- Wild Ancestry: Half-Giants always treat [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate) and [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) as class skills. If the class they possess at level 1 already has one or both of these skills as class skills, they also get a +1 racial bonus to that skill.
- Powerful Build: The physical stature of Half-Giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Half-Giants count as one size category larger when determining their size modifier for [Combat Maneuver Bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) and [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense). A Half-Giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as [grab](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-) or [swallow whole](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-)) can affect him. A Half-Giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty as long as he is proficient with that weapon. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size.
- Low-Light Vision: Half-Giants have low-light vision (they can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light).
- Age:
    - Adulthood: 30 years
    - Middle Age: 45 years
    - Old: 65 years
    - Venerable: 85 years
    - Maximum Age: 125 years

#### Half-Giant Alternate Racial Traits
- Pass for Human: Some Half-Giants, that would be considered very lucky by many, have inherited less of their [[Hill Giants\|Hill Giant]] parent's physical features. These Half-Giants still tend to be very strong for a creature their size but are usually shorter than other Half-Giants and have more defined facial features like that of their smaller parent. A Half-Giant with this racial trait doesn’t need to succeed at a [Disguise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise) check to appear [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]]. In addition Half-Giants with this racial trait only gain [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) as a class skill from their Wild Ancestry racial trait. This racial trait alters Wild Ancestry.
