<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Half-Elves</sup></sup>
A hybrid between [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elves]] and [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]], Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their Elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While Half-Elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be human-like in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. Although the name "Half-Elf" suggests one [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elf]] parent and one [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] parent, Half-Elves can still be second or even third generation before their children start to just become [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]] with some Elven traits.

#### Half-Elves in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]]
Although still uncommon due to the decreased number of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elves]] in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]], Half-Elves make up a small population in the country. Like [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elves]] and [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]] with [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elven]] ancestry, Half-Elves are banned from ever holding a position of power in a noble family if they marry into one, as are any children they may have. Outside of the conversative noble houses though, Half-Elves are generally well regarded by [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore's]] people and many are themselves proud of their Elven heritage.
