<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Vanara</sup></sup>
The Vanara are a race of monkey-like humanoids who naturally live in jungle environments. They stand at the same average height as [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]] but have much more hair and tend to be thinner. Vanara have a long prehensile tail that use as a third arm of sorts and tend to be quite proud of its abilities. The race is known for being clever and cunning but have a tendency to be quite mischievous at times and have a pension for preforming pranks, which has led to some other races to be distrusting of them. Across [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]], Vanara have a very similar legend, claiming to have arrived at this land via large groups of floating land masses covered in jungle and some believe that one day these landmasses will reappear and take them to their ancestral home and/or paradise. 
#### Vanara in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]]
Vanara are extremely rare in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]] as they are not a native race to the country, however groups of the monkey-folk have been making pilgrimage to the country as of late due to the appearance of the large floating islands near the [[Infinity Towers\|Infinity Towers]] several years ago. The obvious similarity to their legend of origin on this land has drawn many Vanara to [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]], although the [[Artanis\|Artanis]] family currently aren't allowing any of the pilgrims to actually go to the islands. 
#### Vanara in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]]
In [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]], the Vanara were once native to the jungle now known as the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Bloodvine Jungle\|Bloodvine Jungle]] and claim to have lead a great kingdom from there but the Vanara were almost entirely wiped out by savage vampires who, according to Vanara spoken legend, appeared practically overnight and ran rampant in their homeland. The few survivors of the vampire attacks were forced to flee their homes and cross the river north for safety until they discovered the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vafer\|Vafer]]. The [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vafer\|Vafer]] took in these refugees and that is where the majority of the remaining Vanara call their home today, usually acting as servants or assistants for higher ranking [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vafer\|Vafer]]. Vanara legend states that they originally came to this continent on a large group of floating land masses covered in jungles although the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vafer\|Vafer]] think this is simply a myth because they have no record of these floating jungles passing over the land, or existing at all, in their [[Lore Vaults\|Lore Vaults]].
