Dromites are a strange insectile race that live in settlements that are partially above and below the surface. They stand between 3 and 4 feet tall but are their chitin's exterior makes them slightly sturdier than others races of the same size. Their faceted eyes shine bright then they channel psionic energy and their other insectoid traits such as two thin antennae on their head make Dromites stand out. Their small mouths are devoid of external mandibles, but when eating, small internal mandibles are used to help eat. Dromites have three fingers and a thumb, each covered in a pointed carapace, with the same for their four toes.

The vast majority of Dromites are asexual but rarely a male or female Dromite is born. Females have expanded psionic strength and are put in a position of leadership amongst Dromite culture whilst the males, who are less inclined towards psionics but are stronger than the average Dromite act as the personal guard to the females.
#### Dromites in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]]
The clan of Dromites that live inside the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]] have always kept to themselves, not getting involved with the others who live in the area and only rarely leaving the jungles to trade with the people of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/locations/Oranport\|Oranport]]. At least that was the way they had been for as long as anyone could recall but in recent years they have been acting much more aggressive and territorial. Some Dromites have shown up in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/locations/Oranport\|Oranport]] claiming they have left their hive but with no memory as to why. Though these deserters have not received a warm welcome as a string of recent missing persons cases, especially involving children, have been blamed on a rumor that Dromites were burrowing their way into the city and stealing people to feed to some monster they worship back inside the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]].
