<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Orcs</sup></sup>
Orcs were once a predominant goblinoid race on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] eons ago but after the rise of the [[Lord of Rot\|Lord of Rot]] they were nearly exterminated in many parts of the continent. In modern times the largest surviving Orc tribes live on the western half of the continent but are still quite nomadic and roam freely, likely an influence of their short lifespan. "True" Orcs have no relationship with the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Ashlung Orcs\|Ashlung Orcs]] that live in [[The Ashlands\|The Ashlands]] and might even hold some animosity towards them for enslaving the goblinoid races of the area. Orcs aren't inherently friendly with other goblinoids, only making temporary alliances at best, but many would view slavery as a stripping of a warrior's honor which is a grave offense.

Physically, Orcs are larger than the average [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] both in height and muscle mass. They stand between six and 7 feet and weigh between two hundred and three hundred pounds on average. Most have pointed ears, elongated teeth, and brown or green skin but other traits like facial features, hair type (and quantity), and many others are extremely diverse amongst Orcs in the same way as other goblinoids.
