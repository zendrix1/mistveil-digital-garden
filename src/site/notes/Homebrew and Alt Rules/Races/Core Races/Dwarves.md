<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Dwarves</sup></sup>
Dwarves are stout humanoids, usually a foot shorter than their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] counterparts, but much broader. They have thick, heavy bones, tightly packed muscular sinew, and a stability unmatched by other races. This bulk also causes dwarves to weigh as much, if not more than, [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]].
#### Dwarves in the [[Kingdom of Razuth\|Kingdom of Razuth]]
The largest population of Dwarves on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] is the [[Kingdom of Razuth\|Kingdom of Razuth]] and is found throughout the mountains on the north east of the continent. Dwarven legends state that a great Dragon named [[Razuth\|Razuth]] appeared one day and laid waste to the world, mist flowing from it's mouth and covering the world, creating the [[Mistveil\|Mistveil]]. These legends say [[Razuth\|Razuth]] was a creation of fate designed to allow the Dwarves (and specifically their first [[Hero King\|Hero King]]) to prove themselves and be rewarded for doing so. After slaying the Dragon, he fell to the earth, landing on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]], where his body become the mineral rich mountains where the [[Kingdom of Razuth\|Kingdom of Razuth]] now stands and his head became [[Razuth's Maw\|Razuth's Maw]], the volcano south west of the kingdom that constantly spews forth endless ash. The Dwarves of the [[Kingdom of Razuth\|Kingdom of Razuth]] see mining and working stone within the bounds of their kingdom as the reaping of gifts given to them by fate and as such it is seen as a divine experience. Because of this the Dwarves refuse entry in their mines or the creation of new mines by any other race in their borders and will threaten war if this warning is ignored.

The [[Kingdom of Razuth\|Kingdom of Razuth]] operates many mining colonies around northern [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] worked by slaves. These slaves are made up from surrounding races such as [[Bugbears\|Bugbears]] and [[Hobgoblins\|Hobgoblins]] as well as other Dwarves who are from the [[Lower Kingdom\|Lower Kingdom]], which is what the Dwarves call the subterranean section of their territory. The need for more and more of these slaves as the kingdom continues to expand it's colonies without taking the time to make sure the mines have the proper safety measures in place has caused many to die in cave-ins and has garnered the Dwarves a reputation as cruel slavers

Although not social creatures, Dwarves put a large emphasis on appearing and acting noble. This includes ritualistic bathing performed before and after a day of mining as well as after combat. Dwarves tend to be particularly frustrated at [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Kobolds\|Kobolds]] who form mining communities within [[Razuth's Spine\|Razuth's Spine]] but despite constant raids from Dwarves, there always seems to be more [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Kobolds\|Kobolds]].
