They have high variety of skin tones and hair types but commonly have short and very curly hair. Halflings have pointed ears similar to [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elves]] but not as long, they're similar proportionally to [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] ears.

[[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] is home to two small populations of Halflings. The larger and older of the two are a group of Halflings native to the island and living in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Double Plains\|Double Plains]]. They mostly keep to the western shores of the region and have a positive relationship with the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vafer\|Vafer]] who also live in the area. These native Halflings have built their culture around some of the feathered and scaled beasts that can be found in the different regions of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] and take great care in capturing, breeding, and taming them. 

The other group of Halflings found on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] live in the city of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/goblin weald/New Voadlan\|New Voadlan]] and are part of the colonists from the country of [[Esoria\|Esoria]].

The Halflings within [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]] make up a tribe called the Dovi. They live within the jungles of the basin and move throughout the year, following the animals they tame. They have been very successful within [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]] by taming the mighty dinosaurs that live there, but they tell legends of their ancestors who once roamed the great plains outside the earthen walls of the region and they seek a grand return one day when they believe they will learn how to destroy the barriers entirely surrounding their jungles.
