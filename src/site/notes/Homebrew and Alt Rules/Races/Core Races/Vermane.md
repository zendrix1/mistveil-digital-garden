The Vermane are a race of small, mouse-like humanoids who prefer to settle in warm grasslands due to the abundance of food and the availability of hiding places but are known for being able to survive in any environment they find themselves in and can adapt to most situations well. Vermane top out at around three feet tall and weight between twenty five and forty pounds depending on their gender, physical activity, and diet. The Mousefolk are a communal people with massive family units that are composed of dozens of siblings living in tunnels burrowed beneath the ground and dug out huts. Although capable of living off of plants and raw meat, many Vermane families love cooking and tend to have a specialty meal whose recipe is a closely guarded family secret. 
#### Vermane in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]]
The Vermane that can be found on the island nation of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] make their home in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Salesport Mines\|Salesport Mines]]. The hostile, rocky land type is far from the Mousefolk's preferred home and a common belief is that they once lived in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Double Plains\|Double Plains]]. The Vermane chose to live on the islands because they have taken up the role of merchants and hold the thrill of mercantilism in the highest regards in their society. They do mine regular ores and minerals but the real treasure that drew them to the area are the remains of ancient and colossal beasts called [[Tarrasque\|Tarrasque]], which formed into valuable and rare minerals upon their death. Although all parts of the [[Tarrasque\|Tarrasque]] are extremely valuable, their crystalized blood is at the center of the Vermane's trade network and is used as a currency by every faction on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] that trades with the Vermane. The merchants travel up and down the river systems surrounding the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Salesport Mines\|Salesport Mines]] using barges they constructed and materials to upkeep and build more of these barges is the largest commodity desired by the Vermane, as they don't have have access to those materials on their islands and need them to continue their trading.
