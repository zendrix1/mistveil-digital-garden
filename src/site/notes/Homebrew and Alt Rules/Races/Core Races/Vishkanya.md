<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Vishkanya</sup></sup>
Vishkanya are a race of humanoids with serpentine qualities that not much is known about. They appear similar to humans in many ways except that they have a green tint to their skin, sections of scales that appear in different patterns on individuals, a forked tongue, and white or golden eyes. Rarely more dramatic traits can appear on Vishkanya, making them seem more monstrous as well.
#### Vishkanya in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]]
The Vishkanya who live in this area make their home on the east coast of [[Lake Oran\|Lake Oran]] and are expert sailors and fishers. They have lived here for much longer than the inhabitants of the city build around them, [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/locations/Oranport\|Oranport]]. Humans came to the area, originally as profit farmers who wished to live near the lake, some time ago and have since built up the small city that now surrounds the Vishkanya's original homes. The humans have found a place for the Vishkanya in their religion and have tried to assimilate them but for the most part, the Vishkanya would rather be left to themselves and only deal with the rest of the city when needed.
