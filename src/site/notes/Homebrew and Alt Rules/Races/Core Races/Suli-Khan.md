<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Suli-Khan</sup></sup>
The Suli-Khan, normally referred to simply as Suli, are a special race of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|Elves]] who came into existence after a clan of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elves]] were influenced by a powerful [[Efreeti\|Efreeti]] over a thousand years ago; the children those [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|Elves]] bore were the first of the Suli. Suli have the same build as their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elven]] progenitors but tend to have darker skin tones and much shorter lifespans.
#### Suli-Khan in [[Cathair-Shae\|Cathair-Shae]]
On the continent of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] the Suli reside in the city-state of [[Cathair-Shae\|Cathair-Shae]] on the coast of the [[Glittering Gulf\|Glittering Gulf]] where they make a living as merchants and pirates. The Suli worship their ancestors and believe that one should live in comfort and luxury in life before serving their people in death. In [[Cathair-Shae\|Cathair-Shae]] undeath is something to be revered and respected so when a Suli passes away, if they led a good life in the eyes of their people, their bodies are brought to a hidden sacred tomb in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/Deadlands\|Deadlands]] to be brought back by the [[Cursed Sands\|Cursed Sands]]. The Suli who undergo this "resurrection" do not return as mindless hostile undead however like most of the creatures that pass in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/Deadlands\|Deadlands]], they are entombed with a special golden mask that protects their bodies from decomposing and makes them subservient to other Suli. These undead act as the work force for [[Cathair-Shae\|Cathair-Shae]] and perform most of the Suli's manual labor, but are treated with the utmost care by their people.

- Flame Wreath (Su): Once per day as a swift action, a Suli can conjure flames that cover their forearms and any weapons they are wielding. The flames last for a number of rounds equal to the Suli's Charisma modifier (minimum 1) and add the [Flaming](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming/) enhancement to either their unarmed strikes using their arms and/or fists, or any weapons they are wielding if applicable. The magical flames do not damage the Suli nor their equipment.

#### Suli-Khan Alternate Racial Traits
- Desert Adaption: Suli thrive in the desert of their homeland, where their keen instincts and resistance to heat give them a huge edge over their competitors. Those with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks in desert environments and on saves to resist starvation and thirst. This racial trait replaces fire affinity.
- Efreeti Magic (Sp): Some Suli inherit an Efreeti's ability to magically change a creature’s size. They can cast either _[Enlarge Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/enlarge-person/)_ or _[Reduce Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reduce-person/)_ (the Suli chooses when using this ability) once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the Suli's level). This racial trait replaces fire affinity.
- Wildfire Heart: Suli with this trait are as swift and dangerous as a blazing wildfire. They gain a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces adaptive fire resistance and flame wreath.
