<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Kobolds</sup></sup>
Kobolds are small reptilian creatures that stand just shy of three feet tall, plus or minus a few inches. They are all scaled, have horns, and a small tail but other features such as the shape of their head and legs or the coloring of their scales can vary from group to group of Kobolds. A common trait amongst Kobolds is a fascination or worship of [[Dragons\|Dragons]] and the claim that they are descendants of the great beasts.
#### Kobolds in the [[Kingdom of Razuth\|Kingdom of Razuth]]
Kobolds can be found all over the continent of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] but perhaps the largest Kobold civilization makes their home in [[Razuth's Spine\|Razuth's Spine]], much to the frustration of the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] who live there as well.

The Kobolds share the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarf]] belief that the mountain is actually the remains of the ancient [[Dragons\|Dragon]] [[Razuth\|Razuth]] and therefore think that all the mountains' riches should belong to what they see as the children of [[Dragons\|Dragons]], namely Kobolds. This obviously creates a stark contrast with the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] who believe they have an exclusive divine claim to mining in [[Razuth's Spine\|Razuth's Spine]] and the two groups often skirmish in the tunnels beneath the surface.

Like many of their kind, the Kobolds of [[Razuth's Spine\|Razuth's Spine]] are worshippers of [[Dragons\|Dragons]] and have many rituals and prayers that they believe honor the ancient creatures, hoping to one day beckon their return to the land. Very rarely a Kobold egg is covered in colored scale-like patterns and the Kobold who hatches from it is born with some additional draconic traits. These Kobolds are revered by their people and always put into a position of religious authority.
