<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Dhampir</sup></sup>
An extremely rare and tragic race, Dhampir are a result of a bond between a Vampire and a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]]. This bond is not the result of traditional sex or even assault however, a Dhampir is born when a pregnant woman who is very close to going into labor, is attacked by a vampire. If the child manages to survive against all odds, they might absorb tainted blood through their mother and take on traits from the attacker. Their hair, eye, and skin colors resemble unnerving versions of their mothers’; many possess a ghastly pallor, particularly in the sunlight, while those with dark complexions often possess skin the color of a bruise. While many Dhampir can pass as [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|humans]] in ideal conditions, their features are inevitably more pronounced and they move with an unnaturally fluid grace. All Dhampir have elongated incisors and, while not true fangs, these teeth are sharp enough to draw blood and many suffer a reprehensible desire to indulge in sanguinary delights despite the fact that the act provides most Dhampir with no physical benefit. 
#### Dhampir in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]]
Dhampir are mostly unknown across [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]] due to the sparsity of vampires in the country. However if their origin was found out, rest assured, they would likely be chased from towns or even hunted down. 
#### Dhampir in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]]
In [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] the large population of Vampires in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Bloodvine Jungle\|Bloodvine Jungle]] are a constant threat to the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The Vampires' proximity to the only [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] population on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] does occasionally lead to the birth of a Dhampir but due to the extremely difficult circumstances of their creations mean they are still extraordinarily rare. The few that do exist mostly still live among the other colonists in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/goblin weald/New Voadlan\|New Voadlan]], passing as [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]], and trying desperately to keep their origin a secret. The fear of the nocturnal monsters the colonists have means an outed Dhampir *only* being exiled and left to risk the dangerous wilderness would be the best case scenario for them.
