#### Air Sylph Alternate Racial Traits
- Air Insight: Air Sylph spellcasters sometimes find that their elemental heritage makes creatures of Air more willing to serve them. [*Summon Monster*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster) and [*Summon Nature’s Ally*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally) spells that the Air Sylph casts last 2 rounds longer than normal when used to summon creatures with the [Air Subtype](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#TOC-Air-Subtype). This racial trait replaces Air Affinity.
- Run like the Wind: Air Sylph are thin and wispy like the wind that infuses them but some have even more physical traits that resemble that. Air Sylphs with this racial trait has a base land speed of 35 feet instead of 30 feet. This racial trait alters the Air Sylphs Base Speed and replaces Energy Resistance.
- Subtle Change: Some Air Sylphs have appearances much closer to the race they were before their transformation occurred; in fact, they may not even realize their true race. Such Air Sylphs appear to be whichever race they belonged to previously, save perhaps minor features like unusual eye color, and they count as humanoid, with the same subtype as their original race, as well as outsider ([[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Native Subtype\|native]]) for all purposes (such as humanoid-affecting spells such as _Charm Person_ or *Enlarge Person*). These Air Sylphs do not automatically gain the Auran language (but may select it as a bonus language if their Intelligence is high enough). This ability alters the Air Sylph's type, subtype, and languages.
- Sky Speaker: Air Sylphs with this racial trait feel kinship toward the creatures of the air, and can use [*Speak with Animals*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals) once per day to speak to birds or other flying animals. Her caster level for these effects is equal to her character level. This racial trait replaces the Air Sylph’s spell-like ability racial trait.
- Weather Savvy: Some Air Sylphs are so in tune with the natural state of the elements that they can sense the slightest change in atmospheric conditions. Air Sylphs with this trait can spend a full-round action to predict the weather in an area for the next 24 hours. The Air Sylph's prediction is always accurate, but cannot account for spells or supernatural effects that might alter the forecast. This racial trait replaces the Air Sylph’s spell-like ability racial trait.
- Sting like Wind: If an Air Sylph trains to fight they might may find themselves naturally inclined towards a weapon that mimics the natural movements of harsh winds. An Air Sylph with this racial traits gains [Weapon Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/) as a bonus feat but must choose a weapon that deals piercing damage. This racial trait replaces Air Affinity.
- Patience of Wind: Air Sylphs are persistent and patient like the wind infused within them. Air Sylphs with this racial trait gain [Patient Strike](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/patient-strike-combat/) as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces Air Affinity.
