Water Sylphs are slender, tall, and have light blue swirl markings covering their bodies in varying degrees of frequency. Some unique traits Water Sylphs might have could be the ends of their hair flowing as if underwater or the weather tending to turn misty if the Water Sylph stays in the same location for longer than a day or two.

#### Water Sylph Alternate Racial Traits
- Water Insight: Water Sylph spellcasters sometimes find that their elemental heritage makes creatures of Water more willing to serve them. [*Summon Monster*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster) and [*Summon Nature’s Ally*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally) spells that the Water Sylph casts last 2 rounds longer than normal when used to summon creatures with the [Water Subtype](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#TOC-Water-Subtype). This racial trait replaces Water Affinity.
- At Home at Sea: Some Water Sylphs find themselves drawn to the element of their rebirth, water, and have formed the ability to move in water as easily as land. Water Sylphs with this racial trait gain a swim speed of 30 feet. The racial trait replaces Energy Resistance.
- Subtle Change: Some Water Sylphs have appearances much closer to the race they were before their transformation occurred; in fact, they may not even realize their true race. Such Water Sylphs appear to be whichever race they belonged to previously, save perhaps minor features like unusual eye color, and they count as humanoid, with the same subtype as their original race, as well as outsider ([[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Native Subtype\|native]]) for all purposes (such as humanoid-affecting spells such as _charm person_ or enlarge person). These Water Sylphs do not automatically gain the Aquan language (but may select it as a bonus language if their Intelligence is high enough). This ability alters the Water Sylph's type, subtype, and languages.
- Sea Speaker: Water Sylphs with this racial trait feel kinship toward the creatures of the sea, and can use [*Speak With Animals*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals) once per day to speak to fish or other swimming animals. Her caster level for these effects is equal to her character level. This racial trait replaces the Water Sylph’s spell-like ability racial trait.
- Weather Savvy: Some Water Sylphs are so in tune with the natural state of the elements that they can sense the slightest change in atmospheric conditions. Water Sylphs with this trait can spend a full-round action to predict the weather in an area for the next 24 hours. The Water Sylph's prediction is always accurate, but cannot account for spells or supernatural effects that might alter the forecast. This racial trait replaces the Water Sylph’s spell-like ability racial trait.
- Slash like a Wave: If a Water Sylphs trains to fight they might may find themselves naturally inclined towards a weapon that mimics the natural movements of water. A Water Sylph with this racial traits gains [Weapon Focus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/) as a bonus feat but must choose a weapon that deals slashing damage.

Water Sylphs with this racial trait gain [Dodge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dodge-combat-final/) as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces Water Affinity.
