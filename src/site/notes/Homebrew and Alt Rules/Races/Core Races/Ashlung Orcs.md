<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Aasimar</sup></sup>
Ashlung Orcs stand just over 6 feet tall, are muscular in nature and have dark grey skin, similar to the ash they live in. The most interesting thing about this race physically is where they got their name. When they breathe heavily, even when they are outside of the [[Ashlands\|Ashlands]], a small cloud of ash comes from their mouth, looking similar to a breath on a cold day. 
#### Ashlung Orcs in the [[Ashlands\|Ashlands]]
The Orcs of the [[Ashlands\|Ashlands]] have had a troubled history. Their culture was originally no more advanced than any other goblinoid race on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] but they differentiated themselves when the [[Lord of Rot\|Lord of Rot]] begun his conquest of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]]. While the [[Goblins\|Goblins]] and [[Giants\|Giants]] hid in their caves, the Orcs rose up and joined the Dwarves from the neighboring country in fighting back against the Lich and his necromancers. However, after the war was finally over and the [[Lord of Rot\|Lord of Rot]]'s kingdom had fallen, the Orc race was devastated and the remnants of the [[Lord of Rot\|Lord of Rot]]'s forces in the area took advantage of their weakened state to take control of the Orcs. They enslaved the Orcs and brought them to the volcanic mountain, [[Razuth’s Maw\|Razuth’s Maw]]. The necromancers forced the enslaved Orcs to live in the shadow of the fiery mountain and build a great monument, the [[Ash Tower\|Ash Tower]]. The Orcs sought the help of their allies the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] but they were ignored. The [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] moved into their mountains to lick their own wounds and build their empire back to its former strength, even going as far as denying the assistance of the Orcs all together in the war. The necromancers performed experiments on the Orcs to make them a better work force by expanding their intelligence but forcing them to be reliant on consuming ash to survive so that they could never leave the [[Ashlands\|Ashlands]]. After being slaves to the necromancers and their descendants for centuries the Orcs (now called the Ashlung Orcs) picked up many aspects of their culture and added them to their own, but probably the most influential thing the Ashlung Orcs took from the experience, is the mentality that to be free is to restrict the freedom of others. The mistake the slavers made after ruling over the Ashlung Orcs for so long was getting comfortable in their rule. The Ashlung Orcs took advantage of this comfort and rebelled, defeating their slavers. But victory wasn’t enough, the Ashlung Orcs hunted down and slaughtered every last creature who claimed or could claim lordship over their race. Almost immediately after taking over the Ashlands, the Ashlung Orcs started to gather up the other goblinoid races in the surrounding area and push them into slavery. Unlike their original captors or their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarven]] neighbors, the Ashlung Orcs do not treat their slaves with disdain, seeing them as the instrument of their freedom. Although their reign as an independent nation has just begun and their reliance on the ash from [[Razuth's Maw\|Razuth's Maw]] makes expansion near impossible, their ambition and military might should not be underestimated.
