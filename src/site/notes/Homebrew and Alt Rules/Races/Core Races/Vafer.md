<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Vafer</sup></sup>
The Vafer are a race of humanoid foxes and can be born with a number of differing traits. They are all covered in fur but fur color and pattern are unique from individual to individual. In addition some Vafer are born with multiple tails and can either have plantigrade legs similar to [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]] or digitigrade legs closer resembling a fox. This level of dimorphism in a single race is odd but is also shared by their cousin race, the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Amica\|Amica]], whom the Vafer believe share a common ancestor. Vafer are usually shorter than the average [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] by about five inches and also tend to be very thin and slender, even frail at times physically. 
#### Vafer in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]]
The Vafer living in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Double Plains\|Double Plains]] of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] believe that knowledge of the past, specifically written knowledge, is the most important step in finding peace and understanding in your life. They are naturally curious and will often leave home to explore and discover more secrets that they can record before returning to [[Callidus\|Callidus]] to add to the collection of knowledge that the Vafer have gathered there in their [[Lore Vaults\|Lore Vaults]]. In [[Callidus\|Callidus]], decisions are all made by a group of the wisest among the Vafer known as the "[[Council of Ages\|Council of Ages]]" and is lead by the one known as the "[[Divine Heir\|Divine Heir]]" who is a white furred Vafer with red markings and many tails. Through a mysterious ritual, whose details are a closely guarded secret kept only among [[Council of Ages\|Council]] members, when the [[Divine Heir\|Divine Heir]] has passed away they are able to reincarnate their mind and soul into another Vafer, usually one recently born in order to give the new Divine Heir the longest life possible. The inheritor's fur turns white, the red markings appear, and they sprout one tail for each generation of Divine Heir before them. The [[Divine Heir\|Divine Heir]]'s personality is slightly different every generation as the inheritor's mind and soul do not disappear, they merge with the collective minds and souls of each previous [[Divine Heir\|Divine Heir]] which is another reason they prefer the inheritor to be a newborn, so that they don't drastically influence the personality of the [[Divine Heir\|Divine Heir]] in a way that could potentially impair their ability to lead wisely.
