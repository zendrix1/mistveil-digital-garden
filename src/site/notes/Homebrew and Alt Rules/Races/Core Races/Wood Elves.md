<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Wood Elves</sup></sup>
These Elves, once native to the [[Feywilds\|Feywilds]] according to their legends, have been named “Wood Elves” or “Wild Elves” because of where and how they live. The Wood Elves worship nature and have sculpted their culture around those beliefs either focusing on surviving off the land or performing magical rituals to invoke its power. These Elves see animals as emissaries of nature and have been known to form bonds with them, even though their predatory nature and carnivore diet would normally prevent such a thing. Physically, Wood Elves look very similar to [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elves]] except their pointed ears are considerably longer, their features tend to be more intense, and (seemly to adapt to their surroundings) their hair tends to brown like tree bark or white like the snow that blankets their forests, depending on the weather of where they live. 
#### Wood Elves in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]]
Wood Elves in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Divine Kingdom of Baylore]] have no native settlement in the country but take up residence in the city of [[Malfield\|Malfield]], in the [[Canopy District\|Canopy District]]. The Wood Elves came to the city as refugees from the north and were put into a slum recently emptied due to a plague that had revenged the poor communities of the city. Although sold as a generous act of housing, it is mostly accepted that the officials hoped to use the remnant of the plague that still lingered to solve their refugee problem in a way that wouldn't put any blame on themselves. However the talented druids among the refugees were able to completely expel the plague and cure those who were still alive and affected by it. This gave the Wood Elves a lot of support among the residents of the city and, although the nobles may have disagreed, most of the city's residents were happy to consider the area the Wood Elves were thrown to be practically their own mini sovereign nation, and that arrangement mostly lasts to this day. The slum was renamed the [[Canopy District\|Canopy District]] and now is a literal forest grown atop the remains of the old district, a stark contrast to the rest of the very modernized city. 
#### Wood Elves in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]]
The Wood Elves of the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Eversnow Forest\|Eversnow Forest]] are not native to the land of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]], but have been there for so many generations that there are likely none alive that knew the land before their appearance. They reside in the settlement of [[Góra\|Góra]] and mostly keep to themselves, being distrusting of other factions' possible ulterior motive for seeking entrance to their home. This is likely because, when melted down and used to make medicines, the snow of the forest has magical healing properties and the Wood Elves living there are suspicious that others would attempt to seize this magic for themselves if they were to find out about it. Although not outwardly hostile, the Wood Elves of the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Eversnow Forest\|Eversnow Forest]] have pledged to not get involved in the matters of other groups and just seek to live peacefully, partaking in their traditions of ritualistic hunting and prayer.

The caster level for these effects is equal to the user’s character level. The DC for the spell-like abilities is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the user’s Wisdom modifier.

This trait replaces Keen Senses.
