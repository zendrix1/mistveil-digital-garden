<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Duergar</sup></sup>
Native to the [[Cosmology/Inner Realms/Depths\|Depths]], the Duergar are a subterranean race of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]]. Physically Duergar look very similar to their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dwarves\|Dwarven]] cousins except their skin tone ranges from light greys to dark blacks. There are many different settlements, nations, and clans of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Duergar\|Duergar]] in the Depths all with varying cultures but what they tend to have in common is a sense of superiority, often presenting as extreme narcissism, delusions of grandeur, or even bigotry towards perceived "lesser races". Duergar culture is usually very militaristic and disciplined with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This focus on strictness also reflects in their cruel punishments for breaking tradition, normally involving painful public demonstrations or capital punishment.
