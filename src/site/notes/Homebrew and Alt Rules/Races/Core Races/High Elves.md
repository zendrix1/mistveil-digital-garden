<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → High Elves</sup></sup>
High Elves are taller than the average [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] by about six to eight inches, tend to have more slender builds, and are known for their grace, wide eyes, and long pointed ears. Although their skin and hair colors vary wildly, just like [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]], the most common High Elf has lighter toned skin and hair.
#### High Elves in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]]
Long ago, the Elves of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] had their own culture and kingdom but they were one of the first victims of the rise of the [[Lord of Rot\|Lord of Rot]]. All these years later, in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]], the High Elves have joined the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human's]] culture near seamlessly. They may be underrepresented in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore's]] government (a fact that has led many to support the growing power of guilds in the country) but, short of very isolated events, they do not face much discrimination in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]].
