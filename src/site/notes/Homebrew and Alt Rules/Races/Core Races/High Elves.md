<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → High Elves</sup></sup>
High Elves are taller than the average [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] by about six to eight inches, tend to have more slender builds, and are known for their grace, wide eyes, and long pointed ears. Although their skin and hair colors vary wildly, just like [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Humans]], the most common High Elf has lighter toned skin and hair.
#### High Elves in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]]
Long ago, the Elves of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] had their own culture and kingdom but they were one of the first victims of the rise of the [[Lord of Rot\|Lord of Rot]] and he hunted them down ruthlessly. After his empire fell, the few groups of surviving High Elves mostly joined with [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] societies. All these years later, in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]], full High Elves are a rare sight but after mingling with them for so long, it isn't rare at all to find [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] families with subtle Elven traits. Although the surviving High Elves do not face much discrimination in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]] day to day, the noble families that run the country still value "pure" [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Humans\|Human]] bloodlines.
