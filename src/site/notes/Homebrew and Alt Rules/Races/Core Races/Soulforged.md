<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Soulforged</sup></sup>
The Soulforged are a mysterious race of living constructs that are quite new to [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]], at least in its current time. These beings were born from an ancient machine discovered in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] which has been given the name, "[[The Soulforge\|The Soulforge]]".

Most Soulforged are born looking fairly similar, with only minor differences in height in composition. These "basic" Soulforged stand around 6-6.5 feet tall and have an internal skeleton made of metal and stone which is covered with wood fibers that function similar to muscles on a human. Those wood fibers are covered with external plating made of the same materials as the skeleton of the Soulforged. Running throughout their bodies is a series of tubes, channels, and pipes that carry a liquid that keeps the Soulforged moving fluidly and keeps their body healthy as well. They are born with three fingers on each hand and two toes on each foot, and crystals for eyes. 

Although the majority of Soulforged fit the above description, some have been born looking radically different. These Soulforged may have different body materials, be significantly smaller or larger than usual, have different types of limbs, or any other number of unique traits. Regardless of what type of Soulforged is born though, all share one trait; a rune carved somewhere on their body, most usually on their forehead. This rune is totally unique to each Soulforged and many proudly display theirs, using it as something of a family crest or personal signature.

Soulforged do not have any biological sex and some never find any interest in whatever gender norms they encounter as they interact with other societies, but others do find these concepts appeal to them and will choose a gender to adapt into their personality.

Soulforged are extremely durable and little very little to survive as they do not need sleep, food, water, or even air to breathe. They are still capable of resting, and sometimes require to in order to do things such as regain magical strength if they are spellcasters, but even in this still state they are fully couscous. They also don't seem to physically age, although they are far too young to know for sure. Most Soulforged don't let these traits go to waste, keeping themselves constantly busy and taking great pride in doing work and helping those around them; be it through construction, artisan, defense work, or anything else they can put their talents towards. Their unknown origins, strange bodies, and near emotionless faces (only capable of basic month movements and brightening or dimming their eyes) leaves many untrusting and fearful of the Soulforged but their relentless work ethic often enamors them to the communities they join if they are just given a chance. 
#### Soulforged in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|the Deadlands]]
The Soulforged of modern times were born in the [[The Soulforge\|the Soulforge]] beneath [[The Lost City\|the Lost City]] in the northeast corner of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|the Deadlands]]. The majority of this early generation (at least those who agreed) were gathered up and brought to [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]] by [[Rexius Artanis\|Rexius Artanis]], but several dozens of them who were born before he arrived escaped from the underground tunnels and made their way westward, into the desert of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|the Deadlands]]. 

These Soulforged, which referred to themselves as "[[The Firstborn\|the Firstborn]]", encountered tribes of nomadic [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] in the desert who helped them understand the world a little more and help direct them where they wished to go. Many of these Soulforged left the larger group to travel to other lands, sometimes on their own and sometimes in smaller splinter groups, others elected to stay with the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] clans that had showed them hospitality in such a hostile environment, but the majority of [[The Firstborn\|the Firstborn]] stayed together in the desert, looking for a place to call their own and following the orders of a Soulforged who goes by the title of "[[Forgeson\|Forgeson]]" and claims to have been the first Soulforged birthed.

One of the larger splinter groups of [[The Firstborn\|the Firstborn]] that desired to leave [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|the Deadlands]] followed a clan of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] west, to a city near the edge of the desert called [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/locations/Oranport\|Oranport]] that sits against the giant earthen wall of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]]. The citizens of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/locations/Oranport\|Oranport]] are naturally distrustful of the Soulforged, doubly so since the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] brought them, but in the short time since they've arrived in the city they have proven themselves invaluable as a labor force and even have found success working with adventurer groups delving into [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Tempest Basin/The Tempest Basin\|the Tempest Basin]] looking for relics. This work ethic has done well to improve their reputation amongst the townsfolk and rumors state the head church is seeking a way to incorporate the Soulforged into their folds (which is causing tensions in its own right) but they still have a way to go before they are truly accepted in the region.

- Ability Score Racial Traits: Soulforged are fast learners and extremely durable, but were created with little sense of personal identity. They receive +2 Con, +2 Int, -2 Wis and -2 Cha.
- Size: Soulforged are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- Type: Soulforged are humanoids with the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Awoken Subtype\|Awoken Subtype]].
- Base Speed: Soulforged have a base speed of 30 feet.
- Languages: Soulforged are born with a basic understanding of Common but can master the language quickly.

- Tireless: Soulforged do not require Swim checks to resist nonlethal damage from exhaustion, Constitution checks to continue running or to avoid nonlethal damage from a forced march, or Fortitude saves to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments. Soulforged count as having the Endurance feat for all purposes.
- Plating: At 1st level a Soulforged receives a suit of masterwork light or medium armor for free, which cannot be sundered or removed. Due to its integration with the Soulforged body, the plating's maximum Dex bonus is increased by 1 and its armor check penalties are reduced by 1. Plating is considered weightless for determining encumbrance. Regardless of the type of armor it is based on, plating is constructed of the same materials as the rest of the Soulforged's body and thus may not be constructed of special materials (unless you select the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/Racial Feats/Advanced Construction\|Advanced Construction]] feat at 1st level). Plating may be enchanted as magic armor, though the Soulforged must be present at all times during the process.
- Natural Weapon: Soulforge have a slam attack that 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage.
- Darkvision: Soulforged can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.

#### Soulforged Alternate Racial Traits

If the integrated weapon is a two-handed weapon, they must still use their second hand to help wield it. If it is a throwing weapon then they may detach and reattach the limb freely, and it can be sundered while separate. If it is a double weapon then both of the Soulforged's hands are replaced. Unlike their plating, the Soulforged must purchase this weapon normally at 1st level. This ability replaces Natural Weapon.
- Strong Jaw: The Soulforged has a bite attack that deals 1d6 damage and has a critical threat range of 20/x3. This ability replaces Light Fortification and Natural Weapon.
