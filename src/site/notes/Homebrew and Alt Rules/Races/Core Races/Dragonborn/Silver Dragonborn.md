<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] → Silver Dragonborn</sup></sup>
Although not quite as rare as their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Gold Dragonborn\|Gold]] siblings, Silver Dragonborn are also a very rare variation of the race and are also seen as a good omen in the clans of the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/Deadlands\|Deadlands]]; of relief from extreme weather for the upcoming period of time. Physically Silver Dragonborn are on the smaller side of their race with an average height and weight of 5'8" and 230 pounds respectively. They are capable of breathing a cone of silvery moonlight and are also resistant to cold damage.
