<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] → Silver Dragonborn</sup></sup>
Although not quite as rare as their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Gold Dragonborn\|Gold]] siblings, Silver Dragonborn are also a very rare variation of the race and are also seen as a good omen in the clans of the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]]; of relief from extreme weather for the upcoming period of time. Physically Silver Dragonborn are on the smaller side of their race with an average height and weight of 5'8" and 230 pounds respectively. They are capable of breathing a cone of silvery moonlight and are also resistant to cold damage.

- Breath Weapon (Su): Two times per day, Silver Dragonborn can breathe a 15-ft. long cone of moonlight dealing 1d6 points of damage, half the damage is cold damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to cold-based attacks.

Affected creatures suffer half damage on a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Con modifier). Creatures affected by the light of the full moon, such as certain Lycanthrope, count as is they were exposed to it if they fail their saving throw against the Silver Dragonborn's breath weapon.

#### Silver Dragonborn Alternate Racial Traits
- Alternate Natural Attack: Some Dragonborn are more inclined to fight with other natural weapons instead of their jaws. Select either claws (1d4 damage each) or tail slap (1d6 damage) and gain that natural attack instead of a natural bite attack. This racial trait modifies Bite.
- Runner: All Dragonborn naturally have strong legs but some are born especially light and quick on their feet. Your base speed is 35 feet instead of 30 but your Natural Armor trait only grants a +1 natural armor bonus. This racial trait modifies Base Speed and Natural Armor.
