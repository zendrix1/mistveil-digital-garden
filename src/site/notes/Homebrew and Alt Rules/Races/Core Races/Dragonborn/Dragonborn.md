<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Races\|Races]] → Dragonborn</sup></sup>
The Dragonborn are an odd race of humanoids. Their name is derived from their appearance, seeming to be humanoid versions of Dragons, or even a hybrid between a humanoid race and a Dragon. Their actual origin is unknown but, although possible, some scholars doubt that they were actually birthed by dragons because an actual [[True Dragons\|True Dragon]] hasn't been spotted in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] for centuries and that they are more likely just a separate race that is related to Dragons somehow. Other theories include the possibility that they came from across the [[Veil\|Veil]], originated from another Plane of Existence, or were brought into being by arcane experimentation.  Physically Dragonborn can vary based on what color of scales they are hatched with. The scales of most Dragonborn are red, black, green, blue, or white however very rarely a silver or gold scaled Dragonborn is hatched as well. Most often a Dragonborn will hatch with the same color scales as its mother, with the exception of silver and gold, which don't appear to be any more common for mothers of those rare colors, but each newborn has a chance to hatch with any of the seven possible colors; their father doesn't appear to have any influence on their color. A Dragonborn's scale color represents what kind of breath weapon it is capable of manifesting, what element it has a natural resistance to, and other mundane aspects such as average height and weight. Regardless of color, Dragonborn all posses fangs, claws, and a tail; all of which have varying lengths and thickness.
#### Dragonborn in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]]
The Dragonborn in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] live in tight knit clans and are famous for their glassblowing skills. Glass blown by their breath weapons, known as [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Items/Dragonglass\|Dragonglass]], is as tough as iron but lighter and can be sharpened to a razor's edge so it is commonly used to create weaponry ([[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] are a dangerous place after all) but they also make jewelry, decorations, and any number of other items.
