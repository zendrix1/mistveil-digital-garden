<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Inherent Detect Magic</sup></sup>
Upon taking a level in any [Spherecasting Class](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/), you gain the Divination Sphere but are unable to use the *[Sense](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/divination#toc24)* ability and with the following restrictions to the *[Divine](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/divination#toc0)* ability. You cannot spend a spell point to decrease the time it takes to activate the talent nor can you use any of the *Alternate Divinations* options.

If you spend another talent in the Divination Sphere you gain the *Sense* ability and lose the restrictions to the *[Divine](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/divination#toc0)* ability in addition to whatever you gained access to with your talent.
