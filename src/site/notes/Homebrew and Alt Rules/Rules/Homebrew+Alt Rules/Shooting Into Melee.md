<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Shooting Into Melee</sup></sup>
Firing a non-physical projectile into melee does not suffer from the usual -4 penalty to attack rolls if you do not have the [Precise Shot](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/) feat.

For example, most spells that fire off energy-based attacks such as bolts of fire or ray attacks would no longer require [Precise Shot](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/) to avoid the attack penalty but anything that uses a physical projectile such as an arrow, bolt, bullet, or rock (including spells that fire them) do still suffer the normal penalty and require the feat to bypass. 

Reasoning: Although it does make perfect sense that aiming spells into a melee fight that involves an ally would be more difficult, the -4 penalty is so large that Precise Shot effectively becomes a must-have feat for any spellcaster that plans on firing off spells and requiring an archery flavored feat to overcome this restricts build diversity and the ability to take more interesting or fun feats. Removing this feat does not totally break the fiction either has spells having a small amount of "homing in" ability seems perfectly reasonable to me, therefore making them easier to aim than a traditional ranged weapon.
