<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Critical Hits - Automatic Hit</sup></sup> 
Any attack that is within the weapon's critical range is an automatic hit, regardless of if the critical hit is confirmed or if the target of the attack is immune to critical hits.


> [!NOTE] NOTE
> This makes high critical range weapons such as Rapiers and Scimitars *much* more powerful. I find this is a more fun rule to play with, but if your players start to feel like they are being punished for using any other weapons, then this rule should probably be dropped.
