<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Universal Favored Class Bonuses</sup></sup> 
When a player character gains a level in a Favored Class, they may gain one of the following general bonuses:

- +1 Max HP
- 1 Skill Point
- 1/6 bonus feat
- +1 foot to base speed (has no effect in combat until selected 5 times)
- Reduce the weapon nonproficiency penalty with a single weapon by 1. When the penalty reaches 0, you gain proficiency with that weapon.
- Reduce the armor check penalty applied to attack rolls for nonproficiency by 1/2 for one of the following categories: light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, bucklers, light and heavy shields, or tower shields. When you select a single category to benefit from this bonus four times (two for bucklers), you gain proficiency with that category. You cannot select a category of shield or armors if you are not already proficient with all lighter categories.

Alternatively a player character may gain any of the special Favored Class Bonuses that usually specific to different player races even if the player character is not the race that is normally connected to the type of bonus, with GM approval.

**Note**: When using this alternate rule for Favored Class Bonuses the [Faster Learner](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/racial-feats/fast-learner-human/) feat changes to the following: [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Feats/General Feats/Fast Learner (UFCB)\|Fast Learner (UFCB)]]

**Reasoning**: The main purpose of this rule is to make FCBs always be useful regardless of player race and class. That is done in two ways, first by making more generally useful bonuses that apply to more types of characters and second by opening up the racial bonuses. I decided to do this because there are so many repeat bonuses that are shared across multiple races and clearly have nothing to do with the race itself and because I never want something to feel pressured to play a certain race/class combination over what they actually want to play due to wanting to use a FCB that they wouldn't get otherwise. I added the bit about GM approval for the rare few FCBs that actually have a strong connection to their race and might not make any sense on other, very different, races.
