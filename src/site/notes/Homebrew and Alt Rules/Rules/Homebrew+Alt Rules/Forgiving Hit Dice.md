<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Forgiving Hit Dice</sup></sup>
When rolling your hit dice while leveling up, reroll any result of 1. In the case of continual 1’s, you continue to reroll until your result is anything other than a 1.

**Reasoning**: This isn't a change for balance reasons, it is much more simple; rolling hit dice is more fun than taking averages, rolling a 1 is not fun though, this makes the result more likely to be enjoyable.
