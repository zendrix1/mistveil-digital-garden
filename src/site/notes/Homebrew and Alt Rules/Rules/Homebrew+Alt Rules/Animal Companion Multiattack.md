<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Animal Companion Multiattack</sup></sup> 
At 9th level an animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat or the animal companion gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a –5 penalty.

**Normal**: At 9th level an animal companion *must* select Multiattack if they have the prerequisites, with this alternate rule they can choose between the two.

**Reasoning**: Multiattack is a very powerful option for animal companions who are able to utilize it but it seemed unfun that those who can't don't get any benefit, so adding the additional attack made sense.
