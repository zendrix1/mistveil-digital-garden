<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Mixing Archetypes</sup></sup>

When selecting a class to take your first level in, be it during character creation or when multi-classing you may choose up to two archetypes for the class, even if they alter or replace the same class features.

If you selected two archetypes that alter or replace the same class features, when you would gain that new feature you can choose which of the two you would like to keep. If the archetype class feature you forgo has another feature that explicitly builds upon it, that is also lost.

If you only selected one archetype, effectively each change the archetype makes becomes optional so you can choose to keep the base class's feature instead.

As per normal, you are free to select multiple archetypes that do not overlap.

**Special**: This system can easily be exploited due to the vastness of the archetype system in Pathfinder, any changes using these rules must be made alongside the GM or be approved by them.

**Reasoning**: This rule further expands on pathfinder's character options, its best feature in my opinion. It can likely be used for disruptive min-maxing and I wouldn't suggest using it at a table with a inexperienced GM, however it does allow for even more thematic character concepts to be brought to life mechanically, which I think makes it worth using.
