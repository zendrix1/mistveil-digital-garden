##### New Flying Maneuver
**Ascend Quickly** DC 15
While moving upwards at a 45° angle, make a Fly check to move at full speed rather than half speed. 

**Retry?** Varies. You can attempt a Fly check to perform the same maneuver on subsequent rounds. If you are using wings and you fail a Fly check by 5 or more, you plummet to the ground, taking the appropriate falling damage.

##### Change to "Fly up at a greater than 45° angle"
When attempting to Fly up at a greater than 45° angle, you may add +10 to the Fly DC (usually DC 20, now DC 30) in order to move your full speed while doing so instead of half speed.

**Reasoning**: Most other movement types have some way to move quicker while making a skill check such as Sneaking at full speed, and flying itself is already rare enough that making it a little easier to use seems appropriate for PCs who manage to get a fly speed.
