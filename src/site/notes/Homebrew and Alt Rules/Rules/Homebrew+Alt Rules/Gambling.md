These are abstract rules to resolve a 1v1 bluffing based gambling game that involves some skill.

Both players make a Bluff check versus the opponent's Sense Motive check. If they succeed on their bluff they get a +4 on the next roll (which will determine the round) but if they fail they get a -4 on the next roll (that's true for both players).

Then to settle the round both players make a Profession (Gambler) check (with the bonus or penalty) and the winner takes whatever was bet.

There's one exception, because Profession requires you to be trained, if someone was playing and not trained in the skill, they would just make a Wisdom check instead but would only be able to benefit +2 from their bluff if they succeed (they still get -4 if they fail). This makes it so people who are trained in gambling have a clear edge over people who don't.

**Reasoning**: Wanting to gamble on a game of skill and chance is a common thing for players, especially when traveling to inns and taverns. Planned actual games are usually more interesting but might take much too much session time, the players might ask to gamble when you weren't prepared for it, or players may wish to just play using their characters' skills rather than their own. In these cases, some quick abstract rules are probably best.
