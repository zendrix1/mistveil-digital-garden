<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Favored Prestige Class</sup></sup> 
Whenever you take a level in a Prestige Class, if one of the base classes you used to reach the prerequisites for that Prestige Class is a favored class, you may select a favored class bonus as if you leveled up in that base class.

**Reasoning**: Using Prestige Classes is already very discouraged in pathfinder in my opinion due to the change of design of ability scaling from 3.5e DnD. In general those changes are positive but losing out on Favored Class Bonus is just salt in the wound when trying to use a Prestige Class so this small change just makes it a little easier.
