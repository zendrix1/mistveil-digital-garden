<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Glancing Blows</sup></sup>
When an attack roll matches the armor class of the target, the attacker only manages a Glancing Blow. When a glancing blow is scored, the attacker deals minimum damage, as if they rolled all 1's on their damage dice. Abilities that allow reroll of 1's such as the Powerful Sneak Attack rogue talent or abilities that let 1's count as any other number do not apply to Glancing Blows.
