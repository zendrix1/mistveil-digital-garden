<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Glancing Blows</sup></sup>
When an attack roll matches the armor class of the target, the attacker only manages a Glancing Blow. When a glancing blow is scored, the attacker deals minimum damage, as if they rolled all 1's on their damage dice. Abilities that allow reroll of 1's such as the Powerful Sneak Attack rogue talent or abilities that let 1's count as any other number do not apply to Glancing Blows.

In the rare case that someone manages to score and confirm a critical hit while also qualifying for a Glancing Blow, the critical hit overrides these rules and damage is dealt normally for a critical hit.

**Reasoning**: This rule is something that came from a desire to make every point of armor class "count", so having 20 AC means you are still benefiting in some way when enemies hit that 20 exactly. Grant, it works both ways of course and also makes it so enemies have that slight boost to defense as well because of this rule.
