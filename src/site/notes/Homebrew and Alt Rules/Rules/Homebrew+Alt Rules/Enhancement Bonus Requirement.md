<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Enhancement Bonus Requirement</sup></sup> 
Armor and weapons no longer require an enhancement bonus of at least +1 in order to have qualities like Flaming, Keen, Fortification, etc placed on them. However, weapons with no enchantment bonus do not bypass damage reduction as if they were magic.

**Reasoning**: This one is simple, enhancement scores on weapons are powerful but boring. A low level player would usually rather a flaming sword rather than a +1 sword, and giving them a +1 Flaming sword might be too much until they are higher level.
