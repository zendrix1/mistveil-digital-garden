<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Enhancement Bonus Requirement</sup></sup> 
Armor and weapons no longer require an enhancement bonus of at least +1 in order to have qualities like Flaming, Keen, Fortification, etc placed on them. However, weapons with no enchantment bonus do not bypass damage reduction as if they were magic.
