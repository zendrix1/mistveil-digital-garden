<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Native Subtype</sup></sup>
Outsiders with the [native](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/Creature-types/#Native_Subtype) subtype such as [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] and [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Aasimar\|Aasimar]] count as [Humanoids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) _and_ [Outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/Creature-types/#TOC-Outsider) for the purpose of all abilities and effects.

**Reasoning**: Although this is both a very slight nerf and buff, it is mostly for the sanity of players who play Native Outsider races such as the Tiefling. Not being considered a Humanoid can be something that doesn't occur to a lot of players when they try to use spells like Enlarge Person that specifically target Humanoids so this makes those niche cases smoother.
