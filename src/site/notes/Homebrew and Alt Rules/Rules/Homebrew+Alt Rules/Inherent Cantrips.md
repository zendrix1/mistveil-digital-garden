<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Inherent Cantrips</sup></sup>

All Spherecasters gain the [Cantrips](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/general-feats#toc9) feat as a bonus feat the first level they gain a Casting Tradition.

**Reasoning**: This is even brought up in the Spheres of Power system as an alternate rule you could introduce to your table. The main reason I have implemented it is because of the lack of Detect Magic while using Spheres of Power. In pathfinder you gain access to it by picking it as one of your cantrips, something that effectively costs nothing, but in Spheres of Power you only get access to the ability after spending a fairly valuable magic talent.
