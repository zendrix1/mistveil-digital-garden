<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Athletics</sup></sup> 
Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical prowess. The [Climb (Str)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb/) and [Swim (Str)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim/) skills are combined into a single Athletics (Str; Armor Check Penalty) skill. The DCs for doing what Climb and Swim could do remain the same. Any bonuses or penalties to Swim or Climb skill checks are instead applied to Athletics while swimming or climbing respectively. Armor check penalty does apply like normal for strength based skills.
