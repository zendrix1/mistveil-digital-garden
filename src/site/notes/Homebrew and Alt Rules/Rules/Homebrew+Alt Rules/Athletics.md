<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Athletics</sup></sup> 
Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical prowess. The [Climb (Str)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb/) and [Swim (Str)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim/) skills are combined into a single Athletics (Str; Armor Check Penalty) skill. The DCs for doing what Climb and Swim could do remain the same. Any bonuses or penalties to Swim or Climb skill checks are instead applied to Athletics while swimming or climbing respectively. Armor check penalty does apply like normal for strength based skills.

**Reasoning**: Combining these two skills effectively only does a single thing, and that is reduce the amount of skill points necessary to be good at Climbing and Swimming. This was done to help compensate for the lack of skill points many classes who utilize these types of skills get, like Fighter.
