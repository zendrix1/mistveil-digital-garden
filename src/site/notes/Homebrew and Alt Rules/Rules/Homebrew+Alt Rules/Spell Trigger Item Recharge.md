<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Spell Trigger Item Recharge</sup></sup>
A player can use a process similar to item creation to recharge spell trigger magic items such as wands and staves. In order to do this the player must first decide to fully recharge the item or only recharge it to half of its maximum capacity. The base price of recharging a spell trigger item is equal to half the crafting cost (or a forth of the market price). You then modify that cost depending on how many charges you are adding to the item. For example if a wand has 11 charges on it and you want to fully recharge it, you are going to add 39 charges to that wand, which is 78% of the total charges the item could hold meaning it would cost you 78% of the starting price to recharge that wand. Otherwise this process follows the standard item creation rules meaning you normally perform your work at a rate of 1000gp/8 hours, cannot work more than 8 hours per day, cannot make/recharge more than one item per day, even if they would take less than 4 hours each, and must perform a _Spellcraft_ check DC 5 + CL (+5 for each missing requirement) as per usual.

For example, if you have a Wand of Scorching Ray (CL 7 for two rays) with 6 charges on it and you wanted to recharge it back to the full 50 charges, you would start by finding the base recharge price, which would be 5,250gp. Then figure out how many charges are being put onto the wand, 44 in this case, and modify that price (5250 * [44/50]) accordingly. So recharging this wand would cost you 4,620gp and, working under normal conditions, take five days to complete.

If you wanted to recharge the same wand to only half capacity, you would be adding 19 charges to the item instead, costing you (5250 * [19/50]) a total of 1,995gp and two days work under normal conditions.

**Reasoning**: This just felt like something that should have been an option to begin with, allowing item crafters to make a little better use out of the items they create or find or a gold and time cost.
