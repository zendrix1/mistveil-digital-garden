<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Awoken Subtype</sup></sup>
[[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]] have the Awoken subtype, granting the following traits:
- Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, effects that cause the sickened condition, and energy drain.
- Cannot heal damage naturally.
- Affected by spells that target living creatures as well as by those that target constructs.
- Regain only half the normal hit points from magical healing unless it also affects constructs (such as the *[Make Whole](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/make-whole/)* spell) or it originated from the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]] itself. The [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]] still gains full benefit from fast healing and other nonmagical healing sources.
- [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]] bodies are composed of stone, metal and wood, and thus are vulnerable to effects which target creatures composed of these substances. Spells which target objects only have no effect on a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]].
- Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but can still benefit from the effects of consumable spells and magic items such as potions. Although [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Soulforged\|Soulforged]] do not need to sleep, they must rest an equivalent length of time to benefit from class features or effects that require sleep, such as the 8 hours of sleep a [Wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/) requires to replenish their spell slots and prepare new spells.
