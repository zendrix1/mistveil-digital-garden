<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Superior Darkvision</sup></sup> 
Creatures with Superior Darkvision are able to see perfectly in any type of Darkness, including that created by [deeper darkness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deeper-darkness).

**Reasoning**: Although underground natives like Dark Elves usually have twice the distance on their Darkvision, making it more unique and interesting than normal Darkvision that many races have seemed like a good way to differentiate them.
