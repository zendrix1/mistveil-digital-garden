<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Effective Rests</sup></sup>
When players take a long rest of at least eight hours, they restore hit points and ability damage once per day. The amount of hit points healed is equal to the character’s total level plus their constitution modifier for a normal rest and 1 point of ability damage. The character heals twice their level plus their constitution modifier and 2 points ability score damage during a comfortable rest. A comfortable rest would be staying in a warm inn or sleeping in a comfortable bed.

In addition a character with the _[Endurance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/endurance/)_ feat counts normal rests as comfortable rests.
