<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Short Rests</sup></sup>
Parties are able to take a Short Rest of at least 1 hour in order to regain a single use of their limited abilities and potentially heal some hit points.

When performing a Short Rest you are limited to the same activates you are able to partake in while taking a normal rest (eating, sleeping, light conversation, writing, etc).

If you are able to successfully rest for at least 1 hour without major disruption you may regain a single use of any ability that normally is limited per day. For example you may regain one [Spell Point](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/using-spheres-of-power#toc5), one used Spell Slot (with the same spell if it was prepared), one round of a Barbarian's [Rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/Barbarian-unchained/#TOC-Rage-Ex-), etc.

In addition, while using a Short Rest you can attempt to [Treat Deadly Wounds](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal#TOC-Treat-Deadly-Wounds-) using the [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal/) skill to heal you and/or your party. If you decide to do so though, you must also target yourself in order to still regain a single use of an ability from the Short Rest.

Like the normal use of the [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal/) skill this way, it requires 2 uses from the [Healer's Kit](https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Healer%27s%20kit) and gives a -2 penalty for each use that you are lacking, however during a Short Rest you are able to treat additional targets beyond the first by increasing the DC by 2 per additional target but for no additional uses from the [Healer's Kit](https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Healer%27s%20kit). If you fail this check you are unable to treat the wounds of any of the targets and the [Healer's Kit](https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Healer%27s%20kit) uses are lost as per usual and you fail to recover an use of a daily ability.

You can only benefit from up to two Short Rests per day, even if you try and fail to [Treat Deadly Wounds](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal#TOC-Treat-Deadly-Wounds-) during a Short Rest, effectively gaining no benefit, it still counts towards one of your Short Rests for the day.

**Reasoning**: Short rests are an option that allow players to feel more open to using some of the limited abilities they have per day while also giving them another option to restore hit points if anyone has trained in the Heal skill without using magic or feeling the need to retreat from where they are exploring.
