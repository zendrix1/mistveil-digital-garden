<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Moving Through and Sharing an Ally's Space</sup></sup>
Outside of Initiative, movement through an ally's space costs no extra movement if they allow you to pass but you cannot end your movement on their space.

While in Initiative order, moving through an ally's space counts as difficult terrain and follows all appropriate rules and interactions.

No change to sharing space with an Ally, it is not allowed.

_"Ending Your Movement: You can’t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless it is helpless. (Core Rulebook, Pg. 193)"_

**Reasoning**: This is just a rule that has come up at games I have run for years where I wasn't sure what the rules as written were in the moment and had to make a call and this tends to be what most people were happy with so I made it an official houserule in my games.
