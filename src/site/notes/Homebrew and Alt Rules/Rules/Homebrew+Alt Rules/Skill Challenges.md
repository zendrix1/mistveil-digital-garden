<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Skill Challenges</sup></sup>

Skill challenges are an optional mechanics to allow the party to overcome obstacles in a cinematic manner while making use of their skills and quick thinking. During these cinematic moments, players are encouraged to take up some of the imaginative responsibilities of the GM and feel free to take liberties with the obstacles that are presented in order to justify the skill they would like to use. Anything too outlandish or exploitive can, and should be, shot down by the GM but this is fun opportunity for everyone at the table to flex their storytelling muscles and overcome an obstacle.

Skill challenges begin when the GM presents a situation and announces that the party will attempt to overcome it through a skill challenge. Once everyone is aware that they are in a skill challenge, the following steps are gone through in order.

1. The GM presents the objective, the number of rounds the players will have to complete their objective, and current obstacles the party is trying to overcome in order to complete that objective (more may reveal themselves as the skill challenge goes on).
2. The GM tells the party what the base DC of the challenge will be, so the players have a sense on how likely they are to succeed or fail with their skills.
3. Each player, in any order but only once each per round, proposes which of the obstacles you've laid out they would like to eliminate and pitches how they would use one of their skills to do so that no player has used yet. Alternatively they can offer to use their turn this round assisting another player instead.
4. If they are trying to overcome an obstacle the GM decides if their proposal is viable or not and if it is, asks for a roll.
5. Based on the result of the roll, the GM describes the outcome and the party accrues one "success" or one "failure".
6. Repeat each above step until the party completes their objective by accumulating a number of successes or fails to do so by accumulating too many failures.

### Building a Skill Challenge
To create a skill challenge you first decide what objective the party is trying to accomplish then create a number of obstacles they will face and how many failures they can accrue before the entire task is lost.

Each skill check has a base DC depending on the difficulty of the challenge. These can be adjusted however you want while building the challenge but the table below gives some guidance on what the base DC might be, based on desired difficulty and average player level of the party.

| Level Range | Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard |
|:-----------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:---------:|
|     1-5     |  10  |   15   |  20  |    25     |
|    6-10     |  15  |   20   |  25  |    30     |
|    11-15    |  20  |   25   |  30  |    35     |
|    16-20    |  25  |   30   |  35  |    40     |

A way for the players to gain bonuses on this skill check could be by using their character abilities in conjunction with a skill check. For example a spell that aids in whatever the player is trying can be used alongside an appropriate skill like Spellcraft. The bonus for using an ability this way can also vary depending on how useful the ability is in overcoming the obstacle at hand but generally speaking the more limited the ability is (only usable 1/day is much more limited than 10/day which is much more limited than at-will) the higher the bonus it should give the player.

#### Obstacles 
All skill challenges come with a number of obstacles that the players must overcome in order to complete their objective. These are the complications that their skill challenges are attempting to eliminate.

When a player proposes how they will overcome an obstacle, remember that they are trying to solve the problem it presents not just avoid it. For example if one of the obstacles you present to your players is large pools of acid on the ground and one player suggests that they make use of a teleportation ability in conjunction to a skill check like Spellcraft to appear on the other side, you shouldn't approve their pitch as it didn't actually eliminate the obstacle for the party as the rest of them are still stuck having to deal with it. Now if that player's teleportation ability also allowed for the teleportation of others, then their pitch should be approved as bringing the entire party to the other side of the acid pools would effectively eliminate that as an obstacle for them.

Generally speaking skill challenges will flow better if the players "fail forward". This means that if a player accrues a failure when trying to eliminate an obstacle, that obstacle should still be removed rather than being a hard wall that now someone else needs to try to overcome. Using the same pool of acid example as above, say the player had the ability to teleport everyone across but fails the Spellcraft skill check. The party accrues one failure but you should still describe them *nearly* making it, taking some acid damage as they appear just shy of their target, and removing the obstacle as one they still need to overcome. 

When deciding how many obstacles a skill challenge should have, make sure there are at least as many as the successes the party must accrue (see below) but there can be more because not every obstacle needs to be overcame for all skill challenges.

Obstacles might be individually unique in the challenge, especially easy or difficult to overcome (applying a modifier to the Base DC for the skill check to overcome it) for example. It could also be a mandatory obstacle, meaning no failing forward and no skipping it if there's more obstacles than required successes. Any other traits could be added to an individual obstacle such as being worth 2 successes, risking 2 failures, etc.
<br>
#### Successes and Failures
Skill challenges require the party to accrue a number of successes, in a limited number of rounds, before accruing too many failures.

During creation of the challenge, you decide on how many successes the party needs and what the max amount of failures they can manage without ultimately failing the challenge. Each challenge can be different but a medium difficulty challenge would normally require 1.5x the party size (rounded down) successes, with each difficulty stage adding or removing one required success as appropriate. For example, a standard medium difficulty challenge for a party of 4 or 5 players would require 6 successes. 

You also must decide how many failures the players are able to accrue in their challenge without a complete loss. Like successes each challenge can be different but generally the party can "safely" accrue failures equal to half the party size (rounded down), and any more than that will cause the challenge to end early in failure. Difficulty of the challenge doesn't usually directly impact the number of failures allowed because reducing how many you are able to accrue by difficulty step would suggest that a party of 4 players cannot make *any* failures on a very hard skill challenge, which may make the scenario feel too luck based. Although something like this could work with a very generous Close Call Threshold (see below) at the GM's discretion.

Finally you decide how many rounds the players will have to accrue their successes. A normal skill challenge will be done in 2 rounds but remember, each player is only able to accrue 1 success per round normally and that's only if they decide not to assist someone else, so ensure you allow for enough rounds for that to even be possible. For example, a party of 4 players who need to accrue 6 successes will need at least 2 rounds to do so. Giving the party more rounds than is minimally required allows for a slightly easier skill challenge, as they can spend more turns assisting others and it allows high skill point characters such as rogues to make more skill checks in general.

Whenever a player successfully makes a skill check they overcome an obstacle and accrue one success for the party and if they fail their skill check they accrue one failure instead. What a failure means exactly is different for each skill challenge. For example it could be a binary win or lose and having one or two failures means nothing in the end as long as you were ultimately able to accrue enough successes to beat the challenge before getting too many failures. Alternatively, perhaps getting one or two failures has no impact on the end result of the challenge but does have immediate consequences such as Hit Point loss or a negative status condition. Or perhaps failures mean nothing during the challenge itself, but how many you accrued impacts what happens after the challenge is finished. For example, if the challenge is to escape a prison, maybe each failure slows you down and results in there being more guards you have to fight through at the prison gates once the challenge has ended.

This means that when building a skill challenge, you need to prepare what it means to accrue a failure, what the results of the challenge will be (and if that result is modular based on how many failures the players had), and what happens if the party fails entirely.

Finally if a player does not wish to attempt a skill check to overcome an obstacle for that round then they may instead assist another player in their skill check. Doing so counts as [Aiding Another](https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=186) for any effects that impact that action (such as the [Helpful](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/race-traits/helpful/) trait for [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Halflings\|Halflings]]) however the assisting player does not need to make the exact same skill check as the primary player, as long as the propose a way to help that makes sense to you they can use that skill instead. For example, maybe one of the obstacles the players will have to overcome in a challenge is getting through rubble in a hallway and a player with a dexterous character wants to try and use their acrobatics to navigate through the rubble and find a safe path. When you approve the use of that skill, another player who doesn't have any ideas to overcome the other available obstacles asks if they use their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Athletics\|Athletics]] skill to move aside some of the heavier pieces of rubble to make the way easier for the primary player's acrobatics check. You approve their assist, and they make their [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Athletics\|Athletics]] skill check versus DC10 and, if successful, grant the primary player a +2 bonus on their Acrobatics roll.
<br>
#### Close Call Thresholds
If players fail their skill check but come very close to making it, you can count that as a "close call", letting them accrue a success and overcome the obstacle as if they had been successful *but* with a consequence. These consequences are similar to ones that may happen to the players when they accrue failures such as Hit Point loss or negative status effects.

A standard close call threshold would be 2 less than the DC but a more forgiving objective might allow for upwards of 5 less than the base DC and a more difficult situation that requires no slip ups might have a threshold of 0, effectively removing this mechanic from that skill challenge entirely.
<br>
#### Other Considerations
You may have noticed that a lot of the specifics about skill challenges are left vague. That is because skill challenges are intended to be extremely versatile and able to mold themselves into nearly any scenario where the GM wants one. These rules are simply guidelines to follow to fit skill challenges best into your game.

Other things, such as allowing a player to use a Hero Point to automatically get a success for their turn or accumulating double successes after an incredibly high skill result are also things you might want to use to adjust and personalize your Skill Challenges as you see fit.

### Example Skill Challenge
TODO: old example below

The objective is to catch and fight a bomber who's running through a city. The party must have 4 successes before they accrue 3 failures. Once the Skill Challenge is over and the combat begins, the party will get a bonus action if they had no failures, nothing extra if they had 1 failure,  and the bomber will get a bonus action if they had 2 failures. If the party fails entirely, the bomber destroys his main target and gets away for now.

You tell the party that Acrobatics can be used to quickly dodge out of the way of civilians to catch up to the bomber and [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Athletics\|Athletics]] could be used to climb up a building quick enough to get an advantage by taking to the rooftops. And you tell them that the base DC is going to be 15 for this skill challenge.

The turn order is determined based on passive initiative and starting with Player 1 they ask if they can use their Diplomacy skill to call out for the crowds to move aside. You agree that's reasonable and in line with the examples you gave so the DC doesn't change. Player 1 gets a 22 Diplomacy check so that's one success for the party. Player 2 still isn't too sure about this system yet and asks to pass bringing it to Player 3's turn.

Player 3 decides to use one of your examples and wants to make an [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Athletics\|Athletics]] skill to get up on the rooftops. They roll but unfortunately only get a 12 on their check so fall from where they were climbing and that's one failure point for the party.

Player 4 likes the rooftop idea but his [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Homebrew+Alt Rules/Athletics\|Athletics]] skill is pretty poor so he asks if he can use [*Dimension Door*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door/) to teleport up there. You allow it but call for a Spellcraft check and the DC is going to be 20 for this one as its hard to cast spells during a foot chase after all. Player 4 barely makes it, getting a 20 exactly so he marks off the spell slot and you describe them overshooting their target and nearly falling off the ledge of the roof, but that's still a success; 2 down, 2 to go.

Back to Player 1 who can't use his Diplomacy again but still wants to try and get through this with social skills proposes finding a shortcut through an alleyway that has a guarded gate which he can lie his way through, pretending to be on official business. You allow the attempt but increase the DC to 22 this time as you figure its hard to lie convincingly while you're out of breath and still in a hurry. Player 1 clears the skill check easily still, getting a 29, and gives the party their third success.

Player 2 is ready to participate now and decides they want to try and use Handle Animal to get a nearby man's dog riled up and join the chase, grabbing at the Bomber's pant leg and slowing him down. You agree that's a cool idea and allow it, setting the DC to 25 as there's a lot going on that would make this hard to pull off quickly. The player reminds you though that they have the *[Speak with Animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals/)* spell and ask if they could use that in conjunction with their Handle Animal check. You allow it and decide the final DC will be 20. Player 2 makes they check, getting a 23 total, and that's the party's forth and final success needed.

You narrate the players catching up with the slowed down Bomber and combat begins!
