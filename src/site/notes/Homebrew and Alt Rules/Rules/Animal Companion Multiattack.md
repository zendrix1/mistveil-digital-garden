<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Rules/Rules\|Rules]] → Animal Companion Multiattack</sup></sup> 
At 9th level an animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat or the animal companion gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a –5 penalty.

**Normal**: At 9th level an animal companion *must* select Multiattack if they have the prerequisites, with this alternate rule they can choose between the two.
