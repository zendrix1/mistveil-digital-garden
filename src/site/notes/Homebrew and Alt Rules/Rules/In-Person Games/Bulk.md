The same as Pathfinder 2e's [Bulk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=187) system (copied below) except the penalties for having too much Bulk have changed, described below.

You are considered to be in a light load if your Bulk is 5 + Str mod or lower, a medium load if your Bulk is between 6 + Str mod and 8 + Str mod (with the same penalties as normal for being in a [medium load](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/carrying-capacity/)), and a heavy load if your Bulk is 9 + Str mod or higher (with the same penalties as normal for being in a [heavy load](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/carrying-capacity/)). You cannot hold more Bulk than 10 + Str mod. A larger bipedal creature can carry more weight depending on its size category, as follows: Large ×2, Huge ×4, Gargantuan ×8, Colossal ×16. A smaller creature can carry less weight depending on its size category, as follows: Small ×3/4, Tiny ×1/2, Diminutive ×1/4, Fine ×1/8 (round up to the nearest Bulk amount).

#### Bulk
Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item reflects how difficult the item is to handle, representing its size, weight, and general awkwardness. If you have a high Strength score, you usually don’t need to worry about Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items.

#### Bulk Limits
You can carry an amount of Bulk equal to 5 plus your Strength modifier without penalty. You can’t hold or carry more Bulk than 10 plus your Strength modifier. See description above for the effects of carrying more than 5 + Str mod Bulk.

#### Bulk Values
Items can have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or they can be light (indicated by an L) or negligible (indicated by a —) for the purpose of determining Bulk. For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is 1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you round down fractions (so 9 light items count as 0 Bulk, and 11 light items count as 1 Bulk). Items of negligible Bulk don’t count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.

#### Estimating an Item's Bulk
As a general rule, an item that weighs 5 to 10 pounds is 1 Bulk, an item weighing less than a few ounces is negligible, and anything in between is light. Particularly awkward or unwieldy items might have higher Bulk values. For example, a 10-foot pole isn’t heavy, but its length makes it difficult for you to move while you have one on your person, so its Bulk is 1. Items made for larger or smaller creatures have greater or lesser Bulk, as described in [Items and Sizes](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=256).

#### Bulk of Coins
Coins are a popular means of exchange due to their portability, but they can still add up. A thousand coins of any denomination or combination of denominations count as 1 Bulk. It’s not usually necessary to determine the Bulk of coins in fractions of 1,000; simply round down fractions of 1,000. In other words, 100 coins don’t count as a light item, and 1,999 coins are 1 Bulk, not 2.

#### Bulk of Creatures
You might need to know the Bulk of a creature, especially if you need to carry someone off the battlefield. The table that follows lists the typical Bulk of a creature based on its size, but the GM might adjust this number.
