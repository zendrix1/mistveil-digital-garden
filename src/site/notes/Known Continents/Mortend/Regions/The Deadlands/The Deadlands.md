<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → The Deadlands</sup></sup>
The Deadlands are a large desert in the middle eastern section of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]]. According to historical records, the land was not a naturally formed desert but instead came about after some kind of large magically disaster which annihilated nearly all life in the area. The effects of this catastrophe are still present today in the form of strange magical properties of the land which makes some tasks that require precision, such as teleporting into or out of the desert, quite difficult. The region gets its name, the Deadlands, due to another property of this "magical radiation" that permeates it which causes any living creature that dies within the desert to eventually rise again as an undead creature, making the Deadlands extremely dangerous.
