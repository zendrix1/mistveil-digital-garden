The Sleeping Gods is a pantheon made up of four greater deities and any number of lesser deities that a [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] clan observes. [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who use Sylvan magic, such as [Druids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/) and [Shamans](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman/), are believed to wield the life energy of the Sleeping Gods and return that energy to the Gods after they cast spells. [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who use Divine magic, such as [Clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/) and [Oracles](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/), are referred to as Dreamweavers and are believed to manifest the dead dreams of the Sleeping Gods. All of the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]'s holy symbols (for both their greater and lesser deities) are round in shape leading to tracing a circle around your chest to become a common sign of protection.

## Kumha'Toh'Tonich
Kumha'Toh'Tonich, also referred to as Kumha, the Draconic word for 'sun', is one of four greater deities worshiped by [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] inside [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]]. According to [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] legends, after Naya'Toh'Tonich became the earth and the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who lived atop it came into existence from her dreams, Kumha decided they should be basked in light and warmth so he followed in his sister's footsteps to enter a great slumber and became the sun.

## Naya'Toh'Tonich
Naya'Toh'Tonich, also referred to as Naya, the Draconic word for 'earth', is one of four greater deities worshiped by [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] inside [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]]. Naya was always the most tired of the four Dragon siblings, always napping and moving slowly. But when Shovah'Toh'Tonich became the stars and the black sky it made Naya more tired than she had ever been and she entered a great slumber. She dreamt of great landmasses forming over her and a people who looked like her and her siblings who should walk upon it. She slept for so long that she became the earth, and from her dreams the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] appeared.

## Shovah'Toh'Tonich
Shovah'Toh'Tonich, also referred to as Shovah, the Draconic word for 'stars', is one of the four greater deities worshiped by the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] inside [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]]. She is the oldest of the four Dragon siblings and was the first to enter the Great Sleep after her three younger siblings had wished for a beautiful place where they could play together. Shovah spread her massive black wings as wide as she could and became the dark night sky, her glistening scales becoming the stars. At first her siblings were thrilled to have such a wonderful place to live but eventually become sad that Shovah could not join them and over time they each entered the Great Sleep as well to join her.

## Torha'Toh'Tonich
Torha'Toh'Tonich, also referred to as Torha, the Draconic word for 'moon', is one the four greater deities worshiped by the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] inside [[Known Continents/Mortend/Regions/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]]. Torha is the youngest of the four Dragon siblings and also the most timid. She was closest to Kumha'Toh'Tonich and spent most of her time making sure he didn't accidentally hurt anyone else because of his rash and bold behavior. Torha was the last of the four dragon siblings to enter the Great Sleep and did so only after realizing that Kumha'Toh'Tonich was going too far in his basking of Naya'Toh'Tonich's [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. His radiant sunlight was sustaining them but also hurting them so Torha entered the Great Sleep and became the Moon, taking turns with Kumha'Toh'Tonich to light the earth but her light, although much less bright, was also much more gentle and beautiful.
