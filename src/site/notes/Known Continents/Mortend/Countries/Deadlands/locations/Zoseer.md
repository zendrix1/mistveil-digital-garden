Zoseer is a small town, closer to a village truly, nestled under the shadow of a large dune in the eastern [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/Deadlands\|Deadlands]] and home to the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/factions/Nayax Clan\|Nayax Clan]] of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. The town is the remains of some ruins that the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/factions/Nayax Clan\|Nayax]] had discovered and unearthed before deciding to give up their nomadic ways to stay there. The streets and buildings are adorned with the multicolored [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Items/Dragonglass\|Dragonglass]] that the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] are famous for blowing and the outside of the sanding wall in front of the town, an oasis is only a short walk away which provides the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/factions/Nayax Clan\|Nayax]] with everything they require in order to live, most notably clean water.
