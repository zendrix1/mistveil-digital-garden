Kemmeth is a young [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/White Dragonborn\|White Dragonborn]] who is part of the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/factions/Nayax Clan\|Nayax Clan]] of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who live in the small town of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/locations/Zoseer\|Zoseer]]. Kemmeth is untested due to his age and spends his time exploring the area around [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/locations/Zoseer\|Zoseer]], looking for adventure or anything of use to his clan. He lives with his grandmother whom he takes care of (when she isn't taking care of him). Kemmeth has something of a reputation among the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Deadlands/factions/Nayax Clan\|Nayax]] of getting into trouble or danger and he has the scars to prove those rumors true.
