Baylore is a country on the east coast of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] that is ruled over by noble families of humans.

The country they formed was named the Divine Kingdom of Baylore after the largest of the three houses leading the rebellion. Modern-day Baylore is still run by noble families who each have a number of representatives based on their size that make up a governing council. This council is based in the [[Holy City of Vardona\|Holy City of Vardona]] (named after [[House Vardona\|House Vardona]]), the capital city of Baylore.
