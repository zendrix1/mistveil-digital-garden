<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/Divine Kingdom of Baylore\|Baylore]] → Braxlow</sup></sup>
A medium sized town a few miles off the southwest coast of the [[Deepbed Lake\|Deepbed Lake]], Braxlow is a farming town that used to be a hub for traveling merchants. The majority of businesses in Braxlow are on the main road that comes into the town from the north and bends west, referred to as the "[[King's Road\|King's Road]]" by locals. Entering the town from the north, the first building you'd see would be the "[[King’s Road Inn\|King’s Road Inn]]" which is one of three inns of Braxlow and also the largest of the three.

Lately the town has had it's fair share of trouble. A few years ago a group of [[Manticores\|Manticores]] moved into the area and begun terrorizing the roads until, shortly after, a clan of [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] arrived and offered to defend the roads and hunt the Manticores in return for gold. Lacking other alternatives since no help seemed to be coming from the capital and the [[Manticores\|Manticores]] weren't going north enough to force the soldiers of [[Sandguard Fort\|Sandguard Fort]] to act either, they agreed. The [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Tieflings\|Tieflings]], led by a man who calls himself the [[Barbed Baron\|Barbed Baron]] took over the [[Crumbled Cathedral\|Crumbled Cathedral]] south of Braxlow and begun patrolling the roads and keeping the [[Manticores\|Manticores]] at bay. The arrangement was good at first but the [[Barbed Baron\|Barbed Baron]] begun to increase the protection prices and started charging a large "tax" of anyone entering the area via the [[King's Road\|King's Road]] which has kept away merchants and traveler's for years, drying up most of the area's economy. Many businesses refused to pay the [[Barbed Baron\|Baron]] after this all started but once the [[Manticores\|Manticores]] started to attack the town and the [[Barbed Baron\|Baron]]'s men only protected the businesses who paid, most who survived came around to their demands.

On top of troubles with flying beasts and exorbitant taxes, something strange and unexplained happened in the noble manor outside of the town and ever since then the residents of the town have been suffering from terrible nightmares. Luckily, in late [[Known Continents/Mortend/The Common Calendar\|Junian]] of 1486 DA, a group of adventurers came to Braxlow and managed to solve whatever strange occurrence was happening in that manor house, curing the town of their nightmares. Only dried dead tree roots emerging from the ground between the manor and the town remain as a reminder of the strange phenomenon.
