One of the Forgemasters of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/locations/Cliffside\|Cliffside]], Ardun Rin specialized in alchemy. He fought in combat alongside [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/people/Hessik Bristlehelm\|Hessik Bristlehelm]] in the [[Formian\|Formian]] raid on the town in 1486 DA but fell to the insectoid creatures before the fight had ended. He was the only Forgemaster to fall in battle but his death has been felt across the town of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/locations/Cliffside\|Cliffside]] which could have used his alchemical expertise to assist in medical care following the raid.
