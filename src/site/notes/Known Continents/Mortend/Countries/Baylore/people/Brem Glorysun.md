The younger cousin of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/people/Hessik Bristlehelm\|Hessik Bristlehelm]], Brem Glorysun is one of the most experienced Forgemasters in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/locations/Cliffside\|Cliffside]]. He was once a member of the [[Bristlehelm Clan\|Bristlehelm Clan]] as well, but choose to forgo his claim to the clan in order to marry a human woman who he fell in love with, [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/people/Selene Glorysun\|Selene Glorysun]]. He had to abandon his family name due to ancient tradition, but [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/people/Hessik Bristlehelm\|Hessik]] approved of the decision and still treats Brem like family. He tries to make a case to reinstitute Brem into the clan every time he visits the clan's home in the [[Kingdom of Razuth\|Kingdom of Razuth]], but so far has made little progress in convincing the clan's elders.
