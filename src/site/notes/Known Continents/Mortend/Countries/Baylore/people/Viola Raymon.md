A [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/High Elves\|High Elf]] living in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/locations/Cliffside\|Cliffside]], Viola moved to the small town from the city of [[Malfield\|Malfield]] years ago to apprentice under [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/people/Ratosh Yan\|Ratosh Yan]] to become a magical craftsman. When she arrived in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Baylore/locations/Cliffside\|Cliffside]] she found that she couldn't stand working under the "crazed fiend" (as Viola called her) and instead became mostly-self taught while getting whatever lessons she could get out of the other Forgemasters who worked here. She eventually managed to become a Forgemaster herself only a few years ago. She was one of the surviving citizens of the [[Formian\|Formian]] raid that destroyed most of the town.
