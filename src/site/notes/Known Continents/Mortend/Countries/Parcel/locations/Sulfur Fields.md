<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] → Sulfur Fields</sup></sup>   
The Sulfur Fields are the warmest location in [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] and scarred by a massive crater created ages ago by a meteorite carrying terrible beasts from another world known as [[Tarrasque\|Tarrasque]]. Thankfully it seems the [[Tarrasque\|Tarrasque]] are gone now but the damage to the surrounding area from the impact is still prevalent in the Sulfur Fields which are marked with volcanic vents spewing toxic fumes, razor sharp rocks, and burning lava. Nestled in the northern mountains is a massive lake of lava with an active volcano in the center, constantly leaking the lava that makes up the lake beneath it.

The primary settlement in the area is the [[Red Acropolis\|Red Acropolis]], a huge fortress made of magically enhanced iron and populated by the militaristic [[Red Dragonspawn\|Red Dragonspawn]].
