<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] → Ruined Desert</sup></sup>  
Composed of the largest and northmost island in the chain of rivers flowing through [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] plus a smaller additional island along the northern coast, the Ruined Desert is named as such because of the numerous husks of ancient buildings that dot the sands. It's unknown exactly what civilization (or civilizations) all the ruins belonged to and, maybe more importantly, what caused them to fall, but the predominate faction of [[Blue Dragonspawn\|Blue Dragonspawn]] in the area has dedicated themselves to solving those mysteries. The smaller island to the north is the home of a massive fort populated by the [[Lumoss\|Lumoss]], a race of humanoid [[Lumoss\|Mothfolk]] who keep to themselves.
