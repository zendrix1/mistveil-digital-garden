<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] → Salesport Mines</sup></sup>  
The Salesport Mines found on two thin mountainous islands in the system of channels that split [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] into it's two main landmasses. The islands are scarcely populated by native creatures but are the home of the industrious [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vermane\|Vermane]] who have carved the earth underneath the islands into a web of mines. These mines hold a very unique resource that the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vermane\|Vermane]] extract and sell to any other faction on Parcël that will trade with them. That unique resource is the remains of giant beasts called [[Tarrasque\|Tarrasque]], who fell from the sky on a massive chunk of rock ages ago. It is unknown why the remains of the colossal creatures are found in this location or how they died to begin with, but unlike traditional organic creatures they do not rot upon death, instead their flesh turns to a metal-like ore and their blood crystalizes into literal veins of gemstones. Those two resources, as well as the everlasting carapace of the [[Tarrasque\|Tarrasque]], is what the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vermane\|Vermane]] gather and trade. In fact, the "[[Blood Rubies\|Blood Rubies]]" traded by the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vermane\|Vermane]] are the closest thing to a universal currency on the island of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]], as any faction who trades with the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vermane\|Vermane]] will accept them and even those who don't might find a use for the extremely rare commodity.
