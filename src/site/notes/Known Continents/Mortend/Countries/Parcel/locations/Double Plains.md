<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] → Double Plains</sup></sup>   
One of the largest regions on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]], taking up nearly a third of the island's landmass, is the Double Plains located on the eastern side of the island and making up much of the eastern, as well as northern, coastlines. The large savanna is split into two sections, west and east, by a river formed at the base of a mountain range and running to, and around, the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Bloodvine Jungle\|Bloodvine Jungle]]. The Double Plains is made up of swathes of grasslands with patches of hilly terrain mostly near the river and mountains. The area is home to many large creatures and two factions of beastfolk, the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Amica\|Amica]] that live primarily on the eastern half of the Plains and the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Vafer\|Vafer]] who take up residence mostly on the west side of the Plains.
