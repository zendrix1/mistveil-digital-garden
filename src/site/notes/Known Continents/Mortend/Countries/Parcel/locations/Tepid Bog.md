<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] → Tepid Bog</sup></sup>   
Spread across two islands in the chain of rivers that split [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] into its eastern and western regions, the Tepid Bog is, as the name suggests, a muggy swamp that begins the transition into the warmer lands west. Although there are more dangerous creatures and more inhospitable regions elsewhere on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]], the combination of the two have prevented any real settlement or culture from taking root in the swamp. What sentient creatures can be found there include small groups of nomadic [[Lizardfolk\|Lizardfolk]] still clinging to the hopes of recapturing the homeland they were pushed out of, now known as the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/Feral Gardens\|Feral Gardens]], and [[Hags\|Hag]] covens that have taken up residence in the swamp themselves when not trying to corrupt and influence others around [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]].
