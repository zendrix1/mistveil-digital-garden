<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] → Eversnow Forest</sup></sup>    
Located in northeastern-most [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]], the Eversnow Forest resides atop a raised plateau and stays in eternal winter. Although the majority of biomes on [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] are strange for unknown reasons, the Eversnow Forest tracks its origin, as well as the origin of its inhabitants, the [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]], back to the [[Feywilds\|Feywilds]]. This is because the Eversnow Forest is not native to [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] but a planted wood who's saplings were brought to the land generations ago by [[Homebrew and Alt Rules/Races/Core Races/Wood Elves\|Wood Elf]] colonists who came from the [[Winter Court\|Winter Court]]. The forest wraps around a pseudo-lake, kept thawed and warmed by volcanic vents deep underneath it. This body of water is home to a group of [[Merfolk\|Merfolk]] who use submerged tunnels to move back and forth from the lake to the ocean coast.
