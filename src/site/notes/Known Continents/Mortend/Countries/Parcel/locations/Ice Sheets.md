<sup><sup>[[Mistveil\|Mistveil]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Mortend\|Mortend]] → [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]] →  Ice Sheets</sup></sup>
The Ice Sheets are a collection of semi-stationary glacial sheets in the northwest of [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/Parcël\|Parcël]], just before the [[Mistveil\|Veil]] begins to form over the ocean. The weather conditions are rough and ocean life in the area are dangerous which makes living on the Ice Sheets difficult and only a handful of creatures make this place their home. The most populous of these creatures are the native goblin tribes that take up residence on the Ice Sheets. These [[Goblins\|Goblins]], unlike their cousins that live in the [[Known Continents/Mortend/Countries/Parcel/locations/goblin weald/Goblin Weald\|Goblin Weald]], are covered in fur and usually have much paler, sometimes white or light blue, skin colors.
